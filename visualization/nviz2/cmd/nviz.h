       When Nviz needs to refer to a map object it uses the logical name
       rather than the map ID.  By setting appropriate logical names, we
       can reuse names inbetween executions of Nviz.  The Nviz library
       also provides a mechanism for aliasing between logical names.
       Thus several logical names may refer to the same map object.
       Aliases are meant to support the case in which two logical names
       happen to be the same.  The Nviz library automatically assigns
       logical names uniquely if they are not specified in the creation
       of a map object.  When loading a saved file containing several map
       objects, it is expected that the map 0bjects will be aliased to
       their previous names.  This ensures that old scripts will work.
