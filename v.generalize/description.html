<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>v.generalize</EM> 
is module for simplification and smoothing of GRASS vector maps. This module
comprises a bunch of algortihms for both simplification and smoothing.

<H2>NOTES</H2>
(Line) generalization is a process of reducing the compexity of vector features.
It transforms a line into another line which consists of fewer vertices but
still approximates the original line. In most of the algorithms below, this
process consists of picking subset of points of the original line.

<P>
On the other hand, (line) smoothing is a "reverse" process which takes as an
input a line and produces smoother line which approximates the original line.
In some cases, this is achieved by inserting new vertices into the line. 
Sometimes, the increase of the number of vertices is dramatical (4000%).
When this situation occurs, it is always a good idea to simplify the line after
smoothing.
</P>
<P>
All the algorithms implemented in this module work line by line. i.e simplification/smoothing
of one line does not affect the other lines. The first and the last point of
each line is never translated and/or deleted. 
</P>

<H2>SIMPLIFICATION</H2>
<P>
<EM>v.generalize</EM> contains following line simplification algorithms
<UL>
<LI>Douglas-Peucker Algorithm</LI>
<LI>"Douglas-Peucker Reduction Algorithm"</LI>
<LI>Lang Algorithm</LI>
<LI>Vertex Reduction</LI>
<LI>Reumann-Witkam Algorithm</LI>
</UL>
<!-- this is not true, reumann support 3D 
<P>
Reuman-Witkam is the only algorithm which works only with 2D maps and does not
support 3D maps. All other algorithms (including smoothing) work with 3D maps.
</P>

Different algorithms require different parameters, but all the algorithms have
one parameter in common. It is <B>threshold</B> parameter. In general, the degree
of simplification increases with the increasing value of <B>threshold</B>.

If some line is simplified and hence becomes shorter than <B>threshold</B> then it is
removed. Also, if <B>type</B> contains <B>area</B> and a simplification algorithm is selected,
the areas of area less than <B>threshold</B> are also removed.

<H2>DETAIL DESCRIPTION</H2>
<UL>
<LI> <I>Douglas-Peucker</I> - "Quicksort" of line simplification, the most widely used
     algorithm. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>. For more
     information, please check: <A href="http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0205/algorithm_0205.htm">http://geometryalgorithms.com/Archive/algorithm_0205/algorithm_0205.htm</A>.</LI>
<LI> <I>Douglas-Peucker Reduction Algorithm</I> is essentially the same algorithm as the
     algorithm above. The difference is that it takes additional parameter <B>reduction</B> 
     which denotes the percentage of the number of points on the new line with respect 
     to the number of points on the original line. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, 
     <B>threshold</B>, <B>reduction</B>.</LI>     
<LI> <I>Lang</I> - Another standard algorithm. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>. 
     For an excellent description, check: <A href="http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/LGmodule/LGLangVisualisation.htm">http://www.sli.unimelb.edu.au/gisweb/LGmodule/LGLangVisualisation.htm</A>.</LI>
<LI> <I>Vertex Reduction</I> - Simplest among the algorithms. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>.
     Given line, this algorithm removes the points of this line which are closer to each other than <B>threshold</B>.
     Precisely, if p1 and p2 are two consecutive points and distance between p2 and p1 is less
     than <B>threshold</B>, it removes p2 and repeats the same
     process on the remaining points.</LI>
<LI> <I>Reuman-Witkam</I> - Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>. This algorithm quite
     reasonably preserves the global characteristics of the lines. For more information
     check <A href="http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/lehre/vorlesungen/GIS1/Lernmodule/Lg/LG_de_6.html">http://www.ifp.uni-stuttgart.de/lehre/vorlesungen/GIS1/Lernmodule/Lg/LG_de_6.html</A>(german)</LI>          
</UL>

<P>
<I>Douglas-Peucker</I> and <I>Douglas-Peucker Reduction Algorithm</I> use the same method
to simplify the lines. Note that 
<DIV class="code"><PRE>
v.generalize input=in output=out method=douglas threshold=eps
</PRE></DIV>
is equivalent to
<DIV class="code"><PRE>
v.generalize input=in output=out method=douglas_reduction threshold=eps reduction=100
</PRE></DIV>
However, in this case, the first method is faster. Also observe that
<I>douglas_reduction</I> never outputs more vertices than <I>douglas</I>. And that,
in general, <I>douglas</I> is more efficient than <I>douglas_reduction</I>.
More importantly, the effect of
<DIV class="code"><PRE>
v.generalize input=in output=out method=douglas_reduction threshold=0 reduction=X
</PRE></DIV>
is that 'out' contains approximately only X% of points of 'in'.
</P>

<H2>SMOOTHING</H2>
<P>
The following smoothing algorithms are implemented in <EM>v.generalize</EM>
<UL>
<LI><I>Boyle's Forward-Looking Algorithm</I> - The position of each point depends on the
    position of the previous points and the point <b>look_ahead</b> ahead. 
    <B>look_ahead</B> consecutive points. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>.</LI>
<LI><I>McMaster's Sliding Averaging Algorithm</I> - Input Parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>slide</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>.
    The new position of each point is the average of the <B>look_ahead</B> points around. Paremeter <B>slide</B>
    is used for linear interpolation between old and new position (see below).</LI>     
<LI><I>McMaster's Distance-Weighting Algorithm</I> - Works by taking the weighted average of <B>look_ahead</B> consecutive points
    where the weight is the reciprocal of the distance from the point to the currently smoothed point. And parameter <B>slide</B> is used
    for linear interpolation between the original position of the point and newly computed position where value 0 means the original position.
    Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>slide</B>, <B>look_ahead</B>.
    </LI>
<LI><I>Chaiken's Algorithm</I> - "Inscribes" a line touching the original line such that the points on this new line
    are at least <I>threshold</I> apart. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>. This algorithm
    approximates given line very well.</LI>
<LI> <I>Hermite Interpolation</I> - This algorithm takes the points of the given line as the control
     points of hermite cubic spline and approximates this spline by the points approximatelly <B>threshold</B> apart.
     This method has excellent results for the small values of <B>threshold</B>, but in this case it produces
     a huge number of new points and some simplification is usually needed. Input parameters: <B>input</B>, <B>threshold</B>, <B>angle_thresh</B>.
     <B>Angle_thresh</B> is used for reducing the number of the outputed points. It denotes the minimal
     angle (in degrees) between two consecutive segements of line.</LI>     
<LI> <I>Snakes</I> is the method of minimization of the "energy" of the line. This method preserves the
     general characteristcs of the lines but smooths the "sharp corners" of the line. Input parameters <B>input</B>, <B>alfa</B>, <B>beta</B>.
     This algorithm works very well for small values of <B>alfa</B> and <B>beta</B> (between 0 and 5). These
     parameters affects the "sharpness" and the curvature of the computed line.</LI>                          
</UL>
</P>
<P>
One of the key advantages of <I>Hermite Interpolation</I> is the fact that the computed line
always passes throught the points of the original line whereas the lines produced by the 
remaining algorithms never pass through these points. In some sense, this algorithm outputs
the line which "circumsrcibes" given line. On the other hand, <I>Chaiken's Algorithm</I> outputs
the line which "inscribes" given line. Moreover this line always touches/intersects the centre
of the line segment between two consecutive points. For more iterations, the property above does
not hold, but the computed lines are very similar to the Bezier Splines. The disadvantage of these
two algorithm is that they increase the number of points. However, <i>Hermite Interpolation</i> can be used
as another simplification algorithm. To achieve this, it is necessary to set <I>angle_thresh</I> to higher values (15 or so). 
</P>
<P>
One restriction on both McMasters' Algorithms is that <I>look_ahead</I> parameter must be odd. Also
note that these algorithms have no effect if <I>look_ahead = 1</I>. 
</P>
<P>
Note that <I>Boyle's</I>, <I>McMasters'</I> and <I>Snakes</I> algorithm are sometime used in the signal processing to smooth the signals.
More importantly, these algorithms never change the number of points on the lines. i.e they only
translate the points, they do not insert any new points. 
</P>
<P>
<I>Snakes</I> Algorithm is the slowest among the algorithms presented here. Also,
it requires quite a lot of memory. This means, that it is not very efficient
for maps with the lines consisting of many segments.
