Individual-based dispersal model for connectivity analysis (time-based) using iterative removal of patches 
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

This modules aims at generating sampling areas which are only known by the
coordinate of one corner. The input are single points, while the output are
areas representing the corresponding area for each of the single
points/coordinates.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The areas can only be generated horizontally, not diagonal. This can be added
as wish and might be implemented in the future.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

An example for the North Carolina sample dataset:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region -d
...
</pre></div>
