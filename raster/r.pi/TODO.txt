@ Martin

- renaming:
  - a name concept should be discussed
  - I renamed all modules to r.pi.*

#####################################
C-code:

r.pi.corrwin and r.pi.corrwindow seem to be duplicates, the main.c version 
are slightly different, but r.pi.corrwin seems to be newer - correct?


- remmove custom 'quiet' flag
- convert C++ style comments
- code must conform to C89 (variable declarations)
- fix all the unused variables
- fix compiler warnings
- there are LOTs of cloned files, put them into a r.pi library (example:
  ~/grass64/vector/lidar/lidarlib/)
  
  File counts:
  - draw.c 4
  - search.c 5
  - helpers.c 13
  - stat_method.c 13
  - func.c 16
  - frag.c 24

  To compare:
   for i in draw.c search.c helpers.c stat_method.c func.c frag.c ; do
       echo "####### $i:"
       ls -l */$i
   done


- fix SVN propsets with this helper script when uploading to Addons (Markus will do):
   grass-addons/tools/module_svn_propset.sh

- some modules use
#define TYPE_NOTHING 0
 while others use
#define TYPE_NOTHING -1
  --> suggestion: use -1 everywhere

#####################################
HTML Descriptions TODO:

- Add North Carolina example to each module, a section has been included everywhere
- ./description.html (overview): polish and update to current module names
- module/description.html files: still TOO GENERAL
