<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.pi</em> (raster patch index) provides various functions to analyse 
spatial attributes of a landscape. It has a focus on patch-based indices 
but delivers class-based indices as well. <em>r.le</em> and its successor
<em>r.li</em> provide landscape indices.

<p>
A list with a short description of the <em>r.pi</em> modules can be found
below. More in depth description of a certain module (commands, flags, 
options) can be found in the  respective folder (like 
<em><A HREF="r.pi.graph.html">r.pi.graph</A></em>). The functions/algorithms
of the modules are not yet very extensive but will be expanded in the
future. Please submit any bug/feature you might encounter to improve the
functionality.
<p>
The program will interactively query the user for input, output and 
options (GUI). However the module can be also run from the terminal 
prompt (CLI) and might be implemented in e.g. a bash-script.
<p>
It is highly recommended to read the help pages or e.g the overview 
documents of <A HREF="http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/documents/fragstats_documents.html">Fragstats</A>
to get a better impression of problems, possibilities and caveats.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h4>Calculation of the SHAPE-Index</h4>

Input can be generated by <em>r.pi.nlm</em>, for example:

<div class="code"><pre>
# generate random landscape with 50% cover
r.pi.nlm output=NLM_in landcover=50 sharpness=0.5

# use the class 1 of the above generated landscape for computation of SHAPE-Index
r.pi.index input=NLM_in keyval=1 output=NLM_in.shape method=shape
</pre></div>


<h4>Calculation of the distance to the first and 10th Nearest Neighbor</h4>

Input generated by <em>r.pi.nlm</em>, for example:

<div class="code"><pre>
# generate random landscape with 50% cover
r.pi.nlm output=NLM_in landcover=50 sharpness=0.5

# first NN
r.pi.index input=NLM_in keyval=1 output=NLM_in.enn1 method=ENN

# 10th NN
r.pi.enn input=NLM_in output=NLM_in.enn10 method=distance number=10

# 1-10th NN
r.pi.enn input=NLM_in output=NLM_in.enn10 method=distance number=1-10
</pre></div>


<h2>NOTE</h2>

The maximum number of patches that can be queried at one time depend on
the module and might also be influenced by the resolution.
