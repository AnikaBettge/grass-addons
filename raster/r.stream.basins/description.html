<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<DL>
<DT><b>-z</b></DT>
<DD>Creates zero-value background instead of NULL. For some reason (like map algebra calculation) zero-valued background may be required. This flag produces zero-filled background instead of null (default).</DD>
<p>
<DT><b>-c</b></DT>
<DD>By default r.stream.basins uses streams category as basin category. In some cases - for example if
stream map is product of map algebra and separete streams may not have unique values this option will create
new category sequence for each basin 
</DD>
<p>
<DT><b>-l</b></DT>
<DD>By default r.strean.basins create basins for all unique streams. This option delinate basins only for last streams ignoring upstreams.
</DD>
<p>

<DT><b>stream</b></DT>
<DD>Stream network: name of input stream map on which ordering will be performed produced by r.watershed or r.stream.extract. Because streams network produced by r.watershed and r.stream.extract may slighty differ in detail it is required to use both stream and direction map produced by the same module. Stream background shall have NULL value or zero value. Background values of NULL are by default produced by r.watershed and r.stream.extract. If not 0 or NULL use <a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a> to set background values to null.  
</DD>
<p>
<DT><b>dir</b></DT>
<DD>Flow direction: name of input direction map produced by r.watershed or r.stream.extract. If r.stream.extract output map is used, it only has non-NULL values in places where streams occur. NULL (nodata) cells are ignored, zero and negative values are valid direction data if they vary from -8 to 8 (CCW from East in steps of 45 degrees). Direction map shall be of type CELL values. Region resolution and map resoultion must be the same. 
Also <em>stream</em> network map must have the same resolution. It is checked by default. If resolutions differ the module informs about it and stops. Region boundary and maps boundary may be differ but it may lead to unexpected results.</DD>

<h2>OUTPUTS</h2>
<P>The module produces one raster map with basins acording user's rules</p>
</DL>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<P>
Module r.stream.basins is prepared to delineate basins and subasins according user rules. Module is prepared to delineate unrestricted number of basins in one step. It requires two maps: direction and streams. In stream map we can store all information required to proper delineation, so it may be necessary to modify it before run. Module is prepared to work with output data of <em>r.watershed, r.stream.extract, r.stream.order</em> also with modification done by <em>r.recalss</em> and <em>r.mapcalc</em>. r.stream.basin can delineate basins according outlets marked by raster streams, points and polygons. If outlets are marked by points it delineate basins which cells contribute to that points, if outlets are marked by streams it delineate cells which contribute to the last (downstream) cell of the every stream. If outlets are marked by polygon it delineate cells contributing to most downstream cell of the polygon. If polygon covers more outlets than of one basins it will create collective basin for all outlets  with common category.


<h2>NOTES</h2>
<P>
Nowadays user's input must be in raster format. Vector format is planned in the feature. To receive good results outlets markers created by user shall overlapping with streams. On the other way basins could results with very small area. Input maps must be in CELL format (default output of r.watershed, r.stream.order  and r.stream.extract)<P>
Module can work only if direction map, stream map and region map has same settings. It is also required that stream map and direction map come from the same source. For lots of reason this limitation probably cannot be omitted.   this means if stream map comes from r.stream.extract also direction map from r.stream.extract must be used. If stream network was generated with MFD method also MFD direction map must be used. Nowadays f direction map comes from r.stream.extract  must be patched by direction map from r.watershed. (with r.patch). 

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<P>
To delineate all basins with categories of streams:
<P>
<CODE>r.stream.basins dir=dirs stream=streams basins=bas_basins_elem</CODE>
<P>
To determine major and minor basins in area, definied by outlets, ignoring subbasins use  - l flag. That flag ignores all nodes and uses only real outlets (in most cases that on map border):
<P>
<CODE>r.stream.basins -l dir=dirs stream=streams basins=bas_basins_last</CODE>
<P>
To delinaeate one or more particular basins defined by given streams, stream map must be re-classed first, to leave only desired streams:
<CODE>
<PRE>
echo '42=42
* = NULL' > tmp #for one output

echo '42 = 42
252 = 252
188 = 188
* = NULL' >tmp #for multiple outputs

r.reclass input=streams output=sel_streams_1 <tmp
</PRE>
</CODE>
<P>
The usage of polygons as outlets markers is very useful when exact stream course cannot be cleary determined before running analysis, but the area of its occurrence can be determined (mostly in iterative simulations) Example uses r.circle but can be substituted by any polygon created for example  with v.digit:
<CODE>
<PRE>
r.circle -b output=circle coordinate=639936.623832,216939.836449 max=200
r.stream.basins -c dir=dirs stream=circle basins=bas_simul
</PRE>
</CODE>
<P>
To determine areas of contribution to streams of particular order  use as streams the result of ordering:
<P>
<CODE>r.stream.basins dir=dirs stream=ord_strahler basins=bas_basin_strahler</CODE>
<P>
Determination of areas of potential source of pollution. The example will be done for lake marked with FULL_HYDR 8056 in North Carolina sample dataset. The lake shall be extracted and converted to binary raster map.

<CODE>
<PRE>
v.extract -d input=lakes@PERMANENT output=lake8056 type=area layer=1 'where=FULL_HYDRO = 8056' new=-1 
v.to.rast input=lake8056 output=lake8056 use=val type=area layer=1 value=1
echo 'sel_streams_lake=if(lake8056,streams,null())'|r.mapcalc
r.stream.basins dir=dirs stream=sel_streams_lake basins=bas_basin_lake
</PRE>
</CODE>
