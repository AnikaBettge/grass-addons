<h2>OPTIONS</h2>

<p>
<DT><b>input</b></DT>
<DD>Name of input raster map to be fuzified. This map may be of any type and may
require null values. 
</DD>
<p>

<DT><b>points</b></DT>
<DD>A list containing 4 (A,B,C,D) or 2 A,B) points defining set boundaries.
Points must not to be in map range, but it may lead to only 0 o 1 membership for
the whole map. For "both" side parameters range between A and D defines base,
but range between B and C core of the fuzzy set. Between A and B and C and D are
set's boundaries. If side is "both" it require 4 points, else 2 points.</DD>

<DT><b>side</b></DT>
<DD>Option indicat if set is fuzzified ob both side s (both), left or right
side. See description for details.</DD>
<p>

<h2>OUTPUTS</h2>
<DT><b>output</b></DT>
<DD>Map containing membership value of original map. Map is alvays of type
FCELLS and contains values from 0 (no membership) to 1 (full membership). Values
between 0 and 1 indicate partial membership</DD>
<p>

<h2>FUZZY SET PARAMETERS</h2>

<DT><b>boundary</b></DT>
<DD>Parameter definied the shape of the fuzzy boundary. The default and most
popular is S-shaped, linear, J-shaped and G-shaped boundaries are also
available. The same boundaires are appled to the both sides.</DD>
<p>

<h3>Boundary definition:<h3>

</center

<DT><b>shape</b></DT>
<DD>Optional shape modifier. Range from -1 to 1. The default value is 0 and
shoud  not be changed in most of the time. The negative values indicate more
dilatant set, the positive values more concentrate set. See description for
details.</DD>

<DT><b>height</b></DT>
<DD>Optional height modifier. Range from 0 to 1. The default value is 1 and
indicate full membership beteen points B and C. If height is lesser than one the
maximum memebrship is equal to height. See image: Fuzzy set definition.</DD>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<P>
<H4>Definition of fuzzy set</H4>
Fuzzy sets are sets whose elements have degrees of membership. Zadeh (1965)
introduced Fuzzy sets as an extension of the classical notion of set. Classical 
membership of elements in a set are binary terms: an element either belongs or
does not belong to the set. Fuzzy set theory use the gradual assessment of the
membership of elements in a set. A membership function valued in the real unit
interval [0, 1]. Classical sets, are special cases of the membership functions
of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1. Classical sets are in
fuzzy set theory usually called crisp sets. The fuzzy set theory can be used in
a wide range of domains in which information is  imprecise, such as most of the
GIS operations.



<h2>NOTES</H2>
<H4>Calculation of boundary shape</H4>
Depending on type of the boundary different equation are used to determine its
shape:
<P>
<B>Linear:</B> the membership is calculated according following equation:<br>
<pre><code>
value  <=  A -> x = 0
A< value > B -> x = (value-A)/(B-A)
B <= value >= C -> x = 1
C< value > D -> x = (D-value)/(D-C)
value  >=  D -> x = 0

where x: membership
</code></pre>
<P>
<B>S-shaped:</B> it use following equation:
<pre><code>
sin(x * Pi/2)^m (for positive shape parameter)
1-cos(x * Pi/2)^m (for nagative shape parameter)

where x: membership, and 
m = 2^exp(2,shape) (for positive shape parameter)
m = 2^(1+shape) (for negative shape parameter)
where m: shape parameter.
</code></pre>

For default shape parameter = 0 m is = 2 whcich is most common parameter for
that equation.

<P>
<B>G-shaped and J shaped:</B> it use following equations: 
<pre><code>
tan(x * Pi/4)^m (for J-shaped)
tan(x * Pi/4)^1/m (for G-shaped)

where x: membership, and 
m = 2^exp(2,shape) (for positive shape parameter)
m = 2^(1+shape) (for negative shape parameter)
where m: shape parameter.
</code></pre>
