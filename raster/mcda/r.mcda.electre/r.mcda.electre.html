<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><B>r.mcda.electre </B>is the implementation of the
ELECTRE multicriteria algorithm in GRASS GIS environment. <SPAN LANG="en-US">It
is one of the available tools in the r.mcda suite. It requires as an
input the list of rasters representing the criteria to be assessed in
the multicriteria evaluation and the vector of weights to be
assigned. Every single cell of the GRASS region is considered as one
of the possible alternatives to evaluate and it is described with the
value assumed for the same cell by the rasters used as criteria.
There are two output files. One represents the spatial distribution
of the concordance index, the other one of the discordance index. The
optimal solution is the one presenting the maximum concordance value
and the minimum discordance value at the same time.</SPAN></P>
<H2>NOTES</H2>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><SPAN LANG="en-US">The module does not standardize
the raster-criteria. Therefore, they must be prepared before by
using, for example, r.mapcalc. The weights vector is always
normalized so that the sum of the weights is 1.</SPAN>
