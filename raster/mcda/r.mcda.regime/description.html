<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<em>r.mcda.regime </em> is
the implementation of the REGIME multicriteria algorithm in GRASS GIS
environment. It is one of the available tools in the r.mcda suite. It
requires as an input the list of rasters representing the criteria to
be assessed in the multicriteria evaluation and the vector of weights
to be assigned. Every single cell of the GRASS region is considered
as one of the possible alternatives to evaluate and it is described
with the value assumed for the same cell by the rasters used as
criteria.</P>
<BR>
<H2>NOTES</H2>
<P>The module does not standardize the raster-criteria. Therefore, they must
be prepared before by using, for example, r.mapcalc. The weights
vector is always normalized so that the sum of the weights is 1.</P>
