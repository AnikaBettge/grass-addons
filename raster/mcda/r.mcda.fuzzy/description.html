<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<em>r.mcda.fuzzy</em> is the implementation of the FUZZY multicriteria
algorithm proposed by Yager R., in GRASS GIS environment. It is one of the
available tools in the r.mcda suite. It requires as an input the list of
raster representing the criteria to be assessed in the multicriteria
evaluation and the vector of linguistic modifiers to be assigned. Every
single cell of the GRASS region is considered as one of the possible
alternatives to evaluate and it is described with the value assumed for
the same cell by the raster used as criteria. It is possible to get three
different output files as the result of the intersection operator, the
union operator and the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator.


<H2>NOTES</H2>
The module does not standardize the raster-criteria. Therefore, they must
be prepared before by using, for example, r.mapcalc. The linguistic
modifiers vector is always normalized so that the sum of the weights is 1.
