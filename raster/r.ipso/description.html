<H2>NOTES</H2>

This curve gives the distribution of surfaces in different altitude ranges. Each
ipsografica point on the curve has a value of quota as ordered and as the abscissa
proportion of the surface of the basin placed above the share in question. Having to
provide a DEM, the curve that is obtained simply as a vector, ordered
decreasing effect of allowances of pixels. Representing the carrier on a diagram
Descartes, no ordinal is proportional to the area above the quota and is given
the abscissa.
The curve is represented by the shares corresponding to percentages of area dominated
(2.5%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, 97.5%).
The ipsometric graph is the same as ipsographic graph but using adimensional axes.

<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

Generate iposographic graph

<div class="code"><pre>
r.ipso.py -b map=elevation.10m image=path/to/output/prefix
</pre></div>

Generate iposmetric graph

<div class="code"><pre>
r.ipso.py -a map=elevation.10m image=path/to/output/prefix
</pre></div>
