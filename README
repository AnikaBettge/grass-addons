GRASS Addons SVN repository
===========================

Installation - Code Compilation
################################

* C code/Scripts, with GRASS source code on your computer:

  Preparations (assuming source code in $HOME/grass64/):
    (if you have already build GRASS from source you don't need to do this
    again. If adding to a binary install the versions must match exactly.
    For a SVN checkout this means that the main GRASS binary and source
    code SVN revisions must match.)
    1. ./configure [opionally flags]
    2. make libs

  The easiest way to compile GRASS Addons modules into your GRASS code 
  is by setting MODULE_TOPDIR on the fly to tell 'make' where to
  find the prepared GRASS source code:

    make MODULE_TOPDIR=$HOME/grass64/

  (adapt to your /path/to/grass6/). Each module/script in the GRASS
  Addons SVN repository should have a Makefile to support easy
  installation.

  Install then into your existing GRASS installation with

    make MODULE_TOPDIR=$HOME/grass64/ install

  This may require "root" priviledges (so, also 'sudo' may help).

* C code/Scripts, with GRASS binaries on your computer:
  compile GRASS Addons modules into your GRASS code by setting 
  MODULE_TOPDIR to where to the GRASS binaries are located:

    make MODULE_TOPDIR=/usr/lib/grass640/

* GEM:
  If you want to install into a *binary* GRASS package, you can use
  the "GRASS Extensions Manager (GEM)":
  http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/html64_user/gem/index.html

Mime-types
##########
# To avoid mime-type recognition problems in SVN,
# each new file's mime-type has to be updated with "svn propset":

Prior to svn commit (first time only), run on your new file(s)

   grass-addons/tools/module_svn_propset.sh <file>

or, simply on all of your new files:

   grass-addons/tools/module_svn_propset.sh *
