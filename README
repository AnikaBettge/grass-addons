Code Compilation
################

The easiest way to compile modules against your GRASS code is
by setting MODULE_TOPDIR on the fly to tell 'make' where to
find the GRASS source code:

  make MODULE_TOPDIR=$HOME/grass63/

(adapt to your /path/to/grass6/)

########################################################################
Mime-types
##########
# To avoid PDF mime-type recognition problems,
# each new (!) PDF file has to be modified like this:
# (unsure how to exclude PDF from the 'diff' email)

svn propset svn:mime-type application/x-pdf *.pdf
svn commit *.pdf

How to get write access here?
#############################

Write access is only granted to developers who agree to abide by
RFC2 - Legal aspects of code contributions
http://download.osgeo.org/grass/grass6_progman/rfc/rfc2_psc.html
and the code submission guidelines (file SUBMITTING in this
directory).

This needs to be communicated to a GRASS developer. S/he will
then possibly propose you to the GRASS Project Steering committee
after a period of evaluation. For details, see
http://download.osgeo.org/grass/grass6_progman/rfc/main.html

Once write access is granted, you, the new developer need to
obtain an "osgeo_id" at http://www.osgeo.org/osgeo_userid
If you already have an "osgeo_id" but forgot it, search for it at
Search at http://www.osgeo.org/cgi-bin/ldap_web_search.py

The write access is then activated by a GRASS developer.
