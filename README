GRASS Addons SVN repository
====================================================

Installation - Code Compilation
################################

* C code/Scripts, with GRASS source code on your computer:

  Preparations (assuming source code in $HOME/grass64/):
    (if you have already build GRASS from source you don't need to do this
    again. If adding to a binary install the versions must match exactly)
    1. ./configure [opionally flags]
    2. make libs

  The easiest way to compile GRASS Addons modules into your GRASS code 
  is by setting MODULE_TOPDIR on the fly to tell 'make' where to
  find the prepared GRASS source code:

    make MODULE_TOPDIR=$HOME/grass64/

  (adapt to your /path/to/grass6/). Each module/script in the GRASS
  Addons SVN repository should have a Makefile to support easy
  installation.


* C code/Scripts, with GRASS binaries on your computer:
  compile GRASS Addons modules into your GRASS code by setting 
  MODULE_TOPDIR to where to the GRASS binaries are located:

    make MODULE_TOPDIR=/usr/lib/grass640/

* GEM:
  If you want to install into a *binary* GRASS package, you can use
  the "GRASS Extensions Manager (GEM)":
  http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/html64_user/gem/index.html

How to get write access here?
#############################

Write access is only granted to developers who agree to abide by
RFC2 - Legal aspects of code contributions
http://download.osgeo.org/grass/grass6_progman/rfc/rfc2_psc.html
and the code submission guidelines (file SUBMITTING in this
directory).

This needs to be communicated to a GRASS developer. S/he will
then possibly propose you to the GRASS Project Steering committee
after a period of evaluation. For details, see
http://download.osgeo.org/grass/grass6_progman/rfc/main.html

Once write access is granted, you, the new developer need to
obtain an "osgeo_id" at http://www.osgeo.org/osgeo_userid
If you already have an "osgeo_id" but forgot it, search for it at
Search at http://www.osgeo.org/cgi-bin/ldap_web_search.py

If there are no objections, the write access is then activated
by a GRASS developer in the OSGeo LDAP for GRASS Addons.
