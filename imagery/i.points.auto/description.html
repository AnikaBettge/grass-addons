<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This module allows a search of GCP's on two raster-maps with differents levels 
of automation.

The manual search is the default search, so it's possible to
determine the GCP's manually with the mouse.

<b>Semiautomated-search</b>
You have to determine with the mouse some corrispondent areas
(with a discrete precision) in the two maps and the module searches the GCP's in these areas. 

<b>Automated-search</b>
At the start of module you have to load the maps that the algorithm uses to the search,
so it's recommended to use the maps filtered with the filters DIVERSITY or STDDEV 
(of GRASS) with a window of 3x3 or 5x5 pixels. However, the algorithm sometimes work
well with the original maps too.

You click the button Automated-Search and then you have to load the maps that you want to
visualize at the end of the search (with the GCP's), usually they are the original maps.

If the maps have strong geometric distortion and strong geometric differencies, maybe 
the results of the search (with the default options) are not good, so you can click the 
button LESS-GCP's and then repeat the operation. 

The Overlap-Points (O.P.) era two corresponding points (one for every maps) that is 
used from the algorithm to determine the overlapping-area in the two maps.
The Master-map is considered the map on the left, and the Slave-map is the map on the right.

Center, top, bottom, left, right are the position of the Master Overlap-Point (on the 
left map) that will be searched on the Slave map (right map). Center is the point at the
center of the map. Top, bottom, left, right are the position of the O.P. respect to
the center of the map. If you choose one of these possibilities, then you have to 
choose the shift from the center, measured in percentage of the dimensions of the map; there
are two possibilities: 5% and 10%.
This type of search is the most automated (fully-automated ).

If you choose -MARK SLAVE O.P.-, then the module visualizes a blue point at the center 
of the master map, and you have to mark the corrispondent point on the slave map.
You can use this function if the maps are overlapped for more of 50% and if the 
algorithm doesn't have success in the fully-automated search.

If the maps have a overlapping area less of 50%, you can use the function -MARK M and S O.P.-.
You have to mark a point in the master map and the corresponding point on the slave map.

At the end of search it's possible to exclude automatically the points not really 
corresponding. This function use the rms with a threshold. The default-value for
the threshold is 2.5, but (before to active the Auto-Exclusion) you can change it,
chossing one of different proposed values; you can choose an arbitrary value with 
click on -OTHER-, so you go on the shell and digit the value from keyboard and confirm 
with ENTER.
