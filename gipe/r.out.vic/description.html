<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM>r.out.vic</EM> creates a set of VIC hydrological model meteorological input ascii files.

1 - Meteorological: Three time series of GIS data are needed: Precipitation (mm/d), Tmax(C) and Tmin(C).

Files are $prefix_latitude_longitude. 

Format is: 
"%.2f  %.2f  %.2f\n"

with:
double precipitation
double Tmax
double Tmin

This is an input to VIC (Variable Infiltration Capacity) in forcing/ of TEST example.


2 - Vegetation: Filling only Land cover class, with only one class, and one standard root system. Option to add monthly LAI (12 maps).

3 - Soil: Barely complete, it takes elevation data and lat/long, the rest is filled up with dummy soil data.


<H2>NOTES</H2>

<H2>TODO</H2>
Soil files input creation is incomplete, a lot to do here.
