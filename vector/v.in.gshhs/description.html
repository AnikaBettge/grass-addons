<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.in.gshhs</em> imports GSHHS shorelines as available on
<a href="ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhs/">ftp://ftp.soest.hawaii.edu/pwessel/gshhs/</a>
<p>
GSHHS shorelines are in latlon but can be imported to any location with 
any projection apart from unreferenced XY projection. Reprojection is 
done on the fly during import.
<p>
Shorelines are imported as lines, not boundaries.
<p>
The categories in layer 1 refer to the type of shoreline: shore, land, 
lake, island in lake, pond in island in lake. The field <tt>type</tt> is 
set to these descriptions. All lines of the same type have the same 
category. The categories in layer 2 refer to the GSHHS ID of each 
imported line. Each line has a unique category value (the GSHHS ID) in 
layer 2, that may be useful for further processing. An attribute table 
for layer 2 is not created.
<p>
The import region is restricted to either the current computational 
region or to the extend specified with the options n, s, e, w. Either of 
the two possibilities must be used. All lines that overlap with the 
specified region are imported, similar to <em>v.in.ogr</em>.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
The GSHHS shorelines are in files named <tt>gshhs_[f|h|i|l|c].b</tt> where 
the letter in brackets indicates the resolution. Only these files can be 
imported, import of world borders and world rivers also included in the zip 
archive is currently not supported.
<p>
The GSHHS shorelines are available at 5 resolutions:
<ul>
<li>f: full resolution
<li>h: high resolution
<li>i: intermediate resolution
<li>l: low resolution
<li>c: coarse resolution
</ul>
<p>
The generated table for layer 1 allows a fast query of the shoreline type.
If needed a table for layer 2 can be added with <em>v.db.addtable</em>. 
The new table can be populated with category values from layer 2 (unique
line ID) with <em>v.to.db</em>. Shoreline type can be uploaded from 
layer 1 to layer 2 with <em>v.to.db</em>.
<p>
Long lines can be split with <em>v.split</em>.
<p>
Lines can be converted to boundaries with <em>v.type</em>.
