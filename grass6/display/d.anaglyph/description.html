<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.anaglyph</em> creates a sterographic 3D image suitable for viewing
either with red/cyan glasses, a stereograph viewer, or by simply crossing
your eyes. Vector line and point maps may be draped over the raster surface.

<p>
Stereograms (two images side by side) will be in full color. Anaglyphs
(needing red/cyan glasses) will be in greyscale, but some colors like
yellow can be used. This module allows creation of stereograms either
in straight mode (requiring a stereoscopic viewer), or cross-eyed, which
you can do "free-view" without any special tools.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The NetPBM image manipulation tools are required.
The output file will be a PNG image.

<p>
For "free-view" cross-eyed stereograms the <b>-g</b> flag is provided to
help guide your eyes, by adding instructions and two white dots to focus on.
It will be hard to focus the dots if they are more than the width of your
eyes appart, in this case it is recommended to not set the image <b>size</b>
of each pane any greater than about 200 pixels, so the two panes look like
bookmarks. The narrower the image the easier it will be to focus on, but
the less you will be able to see.

<p>
For "regular" stereograms to be viewed with a stereograph viewer, the
<b>-g</b> flag will overlay middle-of-image fiducial marks for easier
alignment.

<p>
If draping a <b>color_overlay</b> raster map over the top of a DEM in
anaglyph mode, it works best to first change the color map of the overlay
raster to greyscale or sepia with the <em>r.color</em> module (perhaps with
the <b>-e</b> flag), to avoid any red/cyan in the overlay's color table from
confusing the 3D effect.

<p>
The flatten terrain and equalize contrast flags only operate in anaglyph mode,
and the equalize contrast flags only applies to the base DEM, and will not
have an effect if a <b>color_overlay</b> raster map is used.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

North Carolina dataset anaglyph:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation
d.anaglyph input=elevation output=wake_anaglyph.png size=1280,960 \
   vlines=roadsmajor vpoints=schools_wake
</pre></div>


Spearfish dataset anaglyph:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation.10m
d.anaglyph -e input=elevation.10m output=spearfish_anaglyph.png \
   size=1280,960 z_exag=1.5 vlines=roads vpoints=archsites
</pre></div>


Spearfish dataset cross-eyed stereogram:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region rast=elevation.10m
r.colors -e elevation.10m color=haxby
d.anaglyph -scg input=elevation.10m output=spearfish_stereogram.png \
   size=185,500 viewing_height=27000
</pre></div>

<h2>TODO</h2>

Fine tuning; needs more viewpoint separation when the z-exaggeration is high.
View is currently limited to top-down.
Sometimes one of the images flips (adjust the region width).
