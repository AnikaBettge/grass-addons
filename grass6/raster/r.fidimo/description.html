<h2>NAME</h2>
<em>r.fidimo</em> performs analysis of fish dispersal based on leptokurtic dispersal kernels. It calculates fish dispersal along river corridors based on a users stream network input, fish source populations and species-specific dispersal parameters.


<h2>KEYWORDS</h2>


<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<h3>Stream parameters</h3>
<DL>
<DT><b>river</b></DT>
<DD>Name of input stream network map (thinned raster map) on which the calculations of dispersal is performed. In cases of very maeandering rivers (with bends narrower than the spatial resolution of the analyis (cell size) it is recommended to run v.generalize and r.thin and/or to use r.fidimo.river in advance. The stream network should only consist of tree like structures, as braiding rivers and networks with two-side connected side arms will not work. Check the raster beforehand carefully!
</DD>
<p>
<DT><b>outflow_point</b></DT>
<DD>Name of the outflow point txt-file (single point) for the calculation of the flow direction within the provided river network. The text-file must only contain a single |-separeted coordinate pair (X|Y; same coordinate system as the river network raster). The file should not contain any headings etc. E.g the content of the file can look like:

<div class="code"><pre>
545287.44|1942020.18
</pre></div>
<p>
<DT><b>barriers</b></DT>
<DD>Name of input barrier text-file indicating the geographical position and permeabilty of barriers e.g. weirs. The file should contain the X and Y coordinate and a value for permeability (0-1 where 0 is non-permeable and 1 is 100% passable). The values must be |-separeted:

<div class="code"><pre>

3535061.5179|6064457.5321|0.3
</pre></div>

<h3>Source populations</h3>
The source populations can be provided either as random points (flag -r), or as fixed source population raster (flag -f) . 
<DT><b>n_source</b></DT>
<DD>For the random locations; number or percentage of cells containing source populations. The model selects randomly cell (number specified by the user) and assigns a starting density of 1 to each occupied cell!
</DD>
<DT><b>source_populations</b></DT>
<DD>Input raster map indicating the starting density per cell. All cells with densities > 0 will act as source populations for the model. The raster map must have the resolution as the river raster and all source population cells must also be part of the river raster!
</DD>

<h3>Dispersal parameters</h3>
<DT><b>species</b></DT>
<DD>Selected species with predefined L and AR (see R-package 'fishmove').
</DD>
<DT><b>L</b></DT>
<DD>Length of fish which should be modelled. Increasing L is positively correlated with larger dispersal distances. Setting L will overwrite any species-settings (see R-package 'fishmove').
</DD>
<DT><b>AR</b></DT>
<DD>Aspect ratio of the caudal fin of a fish which should be modelled. Increasing AR is positively correlated with larger dispersal distances. Setting AR will overwrite any species-settings (see R-package 'fishmove').
</DD>
<DT><b>T</b></DT>
<DD>Time interval for one modelling step. The dispersal kernel is time dependent and increasing T is positively correlated with larger dispersal distances (see R-package 'fishmove').
</DD>
<DT><b>p</b></DT>
<DD>Share of the stationary component of the population. The value is set to 0.67 by default (my Paper).
</DD>




<h3>Output</h3>
<DT><b>output</b></DT>
<DD>The base name of the output file(s). The output raster files will be %output%_fit respectively %output%_lwr and %output%_upr if a statistical interval is set.
</DD>
<DT><b>statistical_interval</b></DT>
<DD>Statistical interval (confidence or prediction) derived from the regression analyis (see R-package 'fishmove'). If a statistical interval is set, three output maps will be created (fit, lwr and upr).
</DD>
