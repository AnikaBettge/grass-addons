<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.niche.similarity</em> 

<p>This module will compute two metrics to quantify niche similarity or overlap between all pairs of input raster layers.

<p>One is the niche equivalency or similarity for two species following Warren et al. (2009) based on Schoeners D (Schoener, 1968).
This metric ranges from 0 to 1, representing respectively no overlap and an identical distribution. 

<p>The other is the niche overlap metric which indicates the niche overlap from predictions of species 
distributions with the I similarity statistic of Warren et al. (2009), which is based on Hellinger Distances (van der Vaart,
1998). Note that the corrected I similarity statistic, as given in an erratum of the article, was used, The statistic ranges from 0 (no overlap) to 1 (the distributions are identical). 

<p>The I statistic is also implemented in ENMTools and a number of R packages, including phyloclim and dismo. I would like to thank Christoph Heibl, author of the phyloclim package, for pointing me out the corrected formulation of I.
