This is a GRASS 6.1.0 (and above) extension to perform cumulative viewshed analysis.

If you have GIS Manager installed (which is true per default for a GRASS 6.1.0 installation), you should be able to locate the new modules in a submenu called "Viewshed Analysis" under the "Xtns" menu in the main menu bar.
