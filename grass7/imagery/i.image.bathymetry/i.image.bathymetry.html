<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.image.bathymetry</em> is used to estimate near-shore depth from optical satellite images. Module estimates bathymetry over near-shore region using limited reference depth points. The maximum depth can be estimated by the module is depending up on many factors such as quality of the water and suspended materials etc. (Lyzenga et al., 2006, Kanno and Tanaka, 2012). Our experiments with several multi-spectral optical images indicate that the depth estimates are reliable for when water column is below 20 meter.

Delineation of land and water area are based on combining the result of NDVI and band ratio. NDVI has used to delineate water from land, band ratio between green band and infrared band used to separate the delineated water from clouds, ice etc. Atmospheric and water column correction applied according to the Lyzenga et al., 2006. Corrected spectral bands will be used for weighted multiple regression to estimate depth. R library <em>GWmodel</em> has been used to compute the Geographically Weighted Regression used for depth estimation.
<h2>NOTES</h2>
The input image must include deep water pixels (far away from the coast) which are used to assist water surface and water column correction. Sparse depth points extracted from hydrographic charts or depth pints derived from LiDAR survey or derived from Sonar survey can be used as reference depth for calibration.
<br><br>
 The tide height at the time of reference depth collection and satellite imagery capture should be normalized if it is not. An  option is available in the module to provide tide hieght at the tide of image captured and the module will correct the reference depth accordingly. This option asuumes that the reference depth given is corrected zero tide height. The tide lower than zero can be added as negative value.
<br><br>
The <em>GWmodel</em> adaptive GWR model is memory intensive and cannot be used to process large images. For large images, the estimation is carried out by using non-adaptive GWR implemented in <em>r.gwr</em> module in GRASS GIS. R > 3.1 should be installed to run <em>GWmodel</em> in order to proccess adaptive GWR model for better depth estimation. Default gaussian kernel will be used to estimate geographically weighted regression coefficients.The flag 'b' can be used to change the kernel function gaussian to bi-square.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
In <em>i.image.bathymetry</em> green band, red band, near-infrared band, band for correction and calibration depth points are mandatory input. Additional bands available in the visible wavelength can be used for better depth estimation as optional input. Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) band is suggested to use as "band_for_correction" if it is available (for e.g. satellite images like Landsat-7, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2).An example of depth estimation using Sentinel-2 (MSI) image is shown below 
<br><br>
i.image.bathymetry band1_blue='B2' band2_green='B3' band3_red='B4' band5_nir='B8' band_for_correction='B11' calibration_points='Calibration_points' depth_estimate='output'
<br><br>
If SWIR band is not available near-infrared band can be used as "band_for_correction" (for e.g. satellite images like RapidEye and ALOS AVINIR-2). An example of depth estimation using RapidEye image is shown below image is shown below
<br><br>
i.image.bathymetry band1_blue='B1' band2_green='B2' band3_red='B3' Additional_band1='B4' band5_nir='B5' band_for_correction='B5'  calibration_points='Calibration_points' depth_estimate='output'
