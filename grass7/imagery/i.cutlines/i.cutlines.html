<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.cutlines</em> tiles the images into tiles with irregular borders that
avoid cutting through meaningful objects. This allows tiling an image for
parallel processing while avoiding border effects.

<p>
The approach used in <em>i.cutlines</em> is inspired by Soares et al (2016).
The module first uses an edge detection algorithm (which the user can chose 
with the <b>edge_detection</b> parameter) to identify edges in the image. It
then uses <a href="r.cost.html">r.cost</a> and <a href="r.drain">r.drain</a> to
draw lines through the image, following edges when possible and going straight
when there are none.

<p>
The user can determine the number of lines desired (<b>number_lines</b>) in each
direction and the relative weight given to edges compared to other pixels 
(<b>edge_weight</b>), weight of other pixels being 1. In order to avoid that all
lines gather into one single lowest cost path, the module defines a lane for 
each desired line. The parameter <b>lane_border_resistance</b> defines the cost 
to cross that line, i.e. the lower the value, the more likely cutlines will join
each other. Output can be in the form of raster or vector lines 
(<b>raster_lines</b> and <b>vector_lines</b> parameters) or in the form of 
vector polygon tiles (<b>vector_tiles</b>). For the latter, the user can decide
a minimum size defined in map units (<b>min_tile_size</b>). Tiles smaller than
that size will be merged with the neighboring tile they share the longest 
border with.

<p>
For edge detection the user can chose between the <a href="i.zc.html">i.zc</a> 
module or the <a href="i.edge.html">i.edge</a> addon. For the former, the user
can determine the <b>zc_threshold</b> and the <b>zc_width</b> parameters. For
the latter, the <b>canny_low_threshold</b>, <b>canny_high_threshold</b> and
<b>canny_sigma</b> parameters. See the manual page of the respective modules
for details about these parameters which might need tuning to fit to the 
specific image. As these modules read the entire image into RAM, 
<em>i.cutlines</em> allows the user to run split the image into rectangular 
tiles and to process each tile separately. Tiles can be defined with the 
<b>tile_width</b>, <b>tile_height</b> and <b>overlap</b> parameters. If 
<b>processes</b> is higher than one, these tiles will be processed in parallel
as will the <a href="r.cost.html">r.cost</a> calls for the two directions.

<p>
The <b>memory</b> parameter determines the memory used both for the 
<a href="r.cost.html">r.cost</a> runs.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

There is currently a parameter name conflict between <a href="i.zc.html">i.zc
</a> and the GridModule class in pygrass. Until this is resolved tiled edge 
detection is only possible with <a href="i.edge.html">i.edge</a>.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Using default <a href="i.zc.html">i.zc</a> edge detection without tiling, 
default parameters and 10 horizontal and 10 vertical cutlines, creating
vector polygon output:

<div class="code"><pre> 
g.region rast=ortho_2001_t792_1m
i.cutlines ortho_2001_t792_1m number_lines=10 vector_tiles=ortho_tiles
</pre></div>
