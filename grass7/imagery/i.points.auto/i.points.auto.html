<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<em>i.points.auto</em> tries to automatically generate the given number
of new gound control points. It is recommended to use maps filtered with
the filters DIVERSITY or STDDEV (of GRASS) with a window of 3x3 or 5x5
pixels. However, the algorithm sometimes works well also with the
original maps.
<p>
The actual number of newly generated ground control points will likely
be less than the given maximum number of ground control points because
each generated point is filtered using its FFT correlation
coefficient and optionally also by the given RMS threshold.
<p>
<em>i.points.auto</em> supports the usual transformation orders 1-3 and
requires the corresponding number of previously set ground control
points: 3 for order 1, 6 for order 2, 10 for order 3.
