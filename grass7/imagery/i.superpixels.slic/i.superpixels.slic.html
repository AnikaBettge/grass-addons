<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>i.superpixels.slic</em> performs superpixel segmentation using a 
k means method. The number of superpixels is determined either with the 
<b>k</b> option (number of superpixels) or with the <b>step</b> option 
(distance between initial super pixel centers).
<p>
The <b>co</b> option controls the compactness of the resulting 
superpixels. A larger <b>co</b> value will cause spatially more 
compact, but also spectrally more heterogeneous superpixels. This is 
the most important parameter of the module. A reasonable value should 
be determined for small test regions before applying the module to a 
large region.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
In each iteration, the assignment of pixels to superpixels and the 
superpixels themselves (spatial and spectral means) are updated until 
either the maximum number of iterations is reached or until the 
superpixels no longer change. More iterations will provide better 
results but will increase processing time. Recommended are about 500 
iterations for best results (stabilized superpixels).
<p> 
If a minimum segment size of 2 or larger is given with the <b>min</b> 
parameter, segments with a smaller pixel count will be merged with 
their most similar neighbor.
<p>
If the <b>-n</b> flag is used, the spectral distance of a pixel to a 
given superpixel is divided by the maximum previously observed spectral 
distance to that superpixel. This is the so-called <em>SLIC0</em> (SLIC 
zero) method. After each iteration, the largest spectral distance is 
determined for each superpixel separately. In the next iteration, 
spectral distances of pixels to superpixels are normalized by the 
largest spectral distance of the current superpixel.
<p>
That means that more heterogeneous superpixels have a larger maximum 
spectral distance. For a given pixel, the normalized spectral distance 
will be smaller for a more heterogeneous superpixel than for a more 
homogeneous superpixel. This favours more heterogeneous superpixels 
which can steal pixels from more homogeneous superpixels even if the 
not normalized spectral distance of a pixel to a homogeneous superpixel 
is smaller than to a heterogeneous pixel. As a consequence, 
heterogeneous superpixels can become larger and and even more 
heterogeneous. This effect becomes stronger with larger differences in 
the spectral homogeneity of neighboring superpixels.
