<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>-c</b></dt>
<dd>Print only catchment's characteristics. Useful for shell script calculation
or collecting data in external tables</dd>
<dt><b>-o</b></dt>
<dd>Print only parameters for every order. Usefull to visualise Horton's law with
external software (see example)</dd>
<dt><b>-m</b></dt>
<dd>Only for very large data sets. Use segment library to optimise memory
consumption during analysis</dd>
<dt><b>stream</b></dt>
<dd>Stream network: name of input stream map on which ordering will be performed
produced by r.watershed or r.stream.extract. Because streams network produced by
r.watershed and r.stream.extract may slighty differ in detail it is required to
use both stream and direction map produced by the same module. Stream background
shall have NULL value or zero value. Background values of NULL are by default
produced by r.watershed and r.stream.extract. If not 0 or NULL use <a
href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a> to set background values to null.  
</dd>
<dt><b>dir</b></dt>
<dd>Flow direction: name of input direction map produced by r.watershed or
r.stream.extract. If r.stream.extract output map is used, it only has non-NULL
values in places where streams occur. NULL (nodata) cells are ignored, zero and
negative values are valid direction data if they vary from -8 to 8 (CCW from
East in steps of 45 degrees). Direction map shall be of type CELL values. Region
resolution and map resoultion must be the same. 
Also <em>stream</em> network map must have the same resolution. It is checked by
default. If resolutions differ the module informs about it and stops. Region
boundary and maps boundary may be differ but it may lead to unexpected
results.</dd>

<dt><b>elevation</b></dt>
<dd>Elevation: name of input elevation map. Map can be of type CELL, FCELL or
DCELL. It is not restricted to resolution of region settings as streams and
dirs.</dd>

<h2>OUTPUTS</h2>
Output statistics are send to standard output. To redirect output to file use
redirection operators: > or >>. If redirection is used, output messages are
printed on stderr (usually terminal) while statistics are written to the file.
Statistics can be print as a formatted summary information with number of
parameters or as a catchement's descriptive statistics and table with statistics
for every order. 


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
Module r.stream.stats is prepared to calculate Hotron's statistics of drainage
network.
<p>
These statistics are calculated according formulas given by R.Horton (1945).
Because Horton do not defined precisely what is stream slope, it has been
proposed  proposed 2 different approaches: first (slope) use cell-by-cell slope
calculation, second (gradient) use difference between elevation of outlet and
source of every channel to its length to calculate formula. Bifurcation ratio
for every order is calculated acording formula: 
<code>n_streams[1]/n_stream[i+1]</code>
where i the current order and i+1 next higher order. For max order of the map
number of streams is zero. Rest of the ratios are calculated in similar mode.
The bifurcation and other ratios for the whole catchment (map) is calculated as
mean i.e sum of all bifurcation ratio / max_order-1 (for max_order stream
bifurcation ratio = 0)
It is strongly recommended to extract stream network using basin map created
with r.stream.basin. If whole stream order map is used the calculation will be
performed but results may not have hydrological sense.

For every order (std) means that statstic is calculated with standard deviation:
<ul>
<li>number of streams
<li>total length of streams of  given order
<li>total area of basins of given order 
<li>drainage density
<li>stream density

<li>average length of streams of given order (std)
<li>average slope (cell by cell inclination) of streams of given order (std)
<li>average gradient (spring to outlet inclination ) of streams of given order
(std)
<li>average area of basins of given order (std)
<li>avarage elevation difference of given order (std)
<p>ratios:
<li>bifuracation ratio
<li>length ratio
<li>sloope and gradient ratios
<li>area ratio
</ul>
for the whole basin:
<ul>
<li>total number of streams
<li>total length of streams 
<li>total basin area
<li>drainage density
<li>stream density
<p>ratios:
<li>bifurcation ratio (std)
<li>length ratio (std)
<li>slope and gradient ratios (std)
<li>area ratio (std)
</ul>
<p>
For the whole basins ratios are calculated acording two formulas: as a mean of
ratios for every order, or as a antilog of slope coeficient of the regression
model: order vs. log10(parameter)

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>
Module calculates statistics for all streams in input stream map. It is strongly
recommended to extract only network of one basin, but it is not necessary for
computation.  Streams for desired basin first can be extracted with following
mapcalc formula:

<p>
<code>echo 'sel_streams=if(basin==xxx,streams,null())'|r.mapcalc #xxx category
of desired basin</code>
<p>

It is also possible to calculate Horton's statistics for Shreve ordering but it
has no hydrological sense. Hack (or Gravelius hierarchy) main stream is not the
same what so called Horton's reverse ordering (see: Horton 1945).
<p>
Module can work only if direction map, stream map and region map has same
settings. It is also required that stream map and direction map come from the
same source. For lots of reason this limitation probably cannot be omitted.  
this means if stream map comes from r.stream.extract also direction map from
r.stream.extract must be used. If stream network was generated with MFD method
also MFD direction map must be used.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
Create table with order statistics. This table can easily send to external
program (like R) to be visualised:

<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.stats -o streams=horton dirs=dirs elevation=elevation.10m > tmp_file
R
r=read.csv("tmp_file",skip=1,header=TRUE)
plot(num_of_streams~order,data=r,log="y", 
	main="Sperafish area", 
	sub=paste("Bifurcation ratio: ",
		round(1/10^model$coefficients[2],3)))
model=lm(log10(num_of_streams)~order,data=r)
abline(model)
</pre></div>
