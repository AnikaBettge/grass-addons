<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The Multivariate Environmental Similarity (MES) surfaces was proposed 
by Elith et al (2010) and originally implemented in the Maxent 
software. They described the MES approach as: "The multivariate 
environmental similarity surface (MESS) calculation represents how 
similar a point is to a reference set of points, with respect to a set 
of predictor variables (V1, V2, ...). The values in the MESS are 
influenced by the full distribution of the reference points, so that 
sites within the environmental range of the reference points but in 
relatively unusual environments will have a smaller value than those in 
very common environments."

<em>r.mess</em> computes the MES as well as layers that help to further
interpret the MES values
<ul>
    <li>the individual environmental similarity surfaces (IES)</li>
    <li>the MES (which is simply the mean of the IES)</li>
    <li>the area where for at least one of the variables has a value that
    falls outside the range of values found in the reference set</li>
    <li>the most dissimilar variable (MoD)</li> 
    <li>the mean of the IES layers where IES < 0</li>
    <li>the number of layers with negative values</li>
</ul>

The latter two are useful to distinguish areas where only one or few of 
the variables have values outside the range of the reference set and 
areas where many variables have values outside the range of the 
reference set. 

<p>
The reference points can be a binary raster layer (with 1 representing 
presence and 0 representing absence) or a vector point layer as 
reference points. Any sample of interest can be used for the reference 
set. Examples are points representing occurrence records for the 
species and areas that represent protected areas. 
        
<p>
To compare e.g., current and future environmental conditions the user 
needs to define a reference set of environmental variables (env_old) 
and a set of future environmnental variables (env_new). This is for 
example used to identify areas with novel future climates.

<p>
One can also test for the similarity between two different areas. For 
this one needs to provide a set of environmental variables (env_old) 
and a reference layer (ref_rast) for one region and a second set of 
environmental variables for another region (env_new).
