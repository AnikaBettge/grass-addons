<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The Multivariate Environmental Similarity (MES) surfaces was 
proposed by Elith et al (2010) and originally implemented in the 
Maxent software. They described the MES approach as: "The 
multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) calculation 
represents how similar a point is to a reference set of points, with 
respect to a set of predictor variables (V1, V2, ...). The values in 
the MESS are influenced by the full distribution of the reference 
points, so that sites within the environmental range of the 
reference points but in relatively unusual environments will have a 
smaller value than those in very common environments."

<em>r.mess</em> computes the MES and the individual similarity 
layers (IES - the user can select to delete these layers) and 
optionally a number of other layers that help to further interpret 
the MES values

<ul>
    <li>the area where for at least one of the variables has a value that falls outside the range of values found in the reference set</li>
    <li>the most dissimilar variable (MoD)</li> 
    <li>the mean of the IES layers where IES < 0</li>
    <li>the number of layers with negative values</li>
</ul>

<p>The reference points can be a binary raster layer (with all 
none-NULL values representing presence and NULL values representing 
absence) or a vector point layer as reference points. Any sample of 
interest can be used for the reference set. Examples are points 
representing occurrence records for the species and areas that 
represent protected areas. 
        
<p>To compare e.g., current and future environmental conditions the 
user needs to define a reference set of environmental variables 
(env_old) and a set of future environmnental variables (env_new). 
This is for example used to identify areas with novel future climates.

<p>One can also test for the similarity between two different areas. 
For this one needs to provide a set of environmental variables 
(env_old) and a reference layer (ref_rast) for one region and a 
second set of environmental variables for another region (env_new).
