<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The Multivariate Environmental Similarity (MES) surfaces was 
proposed by Elith et al (2010) [1] and originally implemented in the 
Maxent software. They described the MES approach as: "The 
multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) calculation 
represents how similar a point is to a reference set of points, with 
respect to a set of predictor variables (V1, V2, ...). The values in 
the MESS are influenced by the full distribution of the reference 
points, so that sites within the environmental range of the 
reference points but in relatively unusual environments will have a 
smaller value than those in very common environments."

<em>r.mess</em> computes the MES and the individual similarity 
layers (IES - the user can select to delete these layers) and 
optionally a number of other layers that help to further interpret 
the MES values

<ul>
    <li>the area where for at least one of the variables has a value that falls outside the range of values found in the reference set</li>
    <li>the most dissimilar variable (MoD)</li> 
    <li>the sum of the IES layers where IES < 0. This is similar to the 
    NT1 measure as proposed by Mesgaran et al. 2014 [2]</li>
    <li>the number of layers with negative values</li>
</ul>

<p>The reference points can be a binary raster layer (1 = presence, 
0 = absence) or a vector point layer as reference points. Any sample 
of interest can be used for the reference set. Examples are points 
representing occurrence records for the species and areas that 
represent protected areas. 
        
<p>To compare e.g., current and future environmental conditions the 
user needs to define a reference set of environmental variables 
(env_old) and a set of future environmnental variables (env_new). 
This is for example used to identify areas with novel future climates.

<p>It is also possible to test for the similarity between two 
different areas. In this case you need to provide a set of 
environmental variables (env_old) for the area covered by your 
reference layer and a second set of environmental variables for the 
area you want to compare to (env_new). Make sure the region 
(g.region) is set to the reference layer / env_old.
