<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.vif</em> module computes a stepwise variance inflation factor 
(VIF) and the square root of the VIF. The VIF quantifies how much 
the variance (the square of the estimate's standard deviation) of an 
estimated regression coefficient is increased because of 
collinearity. The square root of VIF is a measure of how much larger 
the standard error is, compared with what it would be if that 
variable were uncorrelated with the other predictor variables in the 
model. 

<p>By default the VIF is calculated for each variable. If the user 
sets a VIF threshold value (maxvif) the VIF will be calculated again 
after removing the variable with the highest VIF. This will be 
repeated till the VIF is smaller than maxvif. This can thus be used 
to select a sub-set of variables for e.g., multiple regression 
analysis. 

<p>The user can optionally select one or more variables to be 
retained in the stepwise selection. For example, the user selects 
the variable <i>bio_5</i> to be retained. If in any step this 
variable has the highest VIF, the variable with the next highet VIF 
will be removed instead (see the examples).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Run VIF for five variables, setting the maximum VIF at 10

<div class="code"><pre>r.vif maps=bio_1,bio_2,bio_3,bio_4,bio_5 
maxvif=10 file=results.txt

VIF bio_1 = 76.6694778809
VIF bio_2 = 13.0044084945
VIF bio_3 = 5.30160850802
VIF bio_4 = 4.24765529428
VIF bio_5 = 96.27418889
VIF bio_1 = 1.09855463167
VIF bio_2 = 1.99532296297
VIF bio_3 = 4.36471563878
VIF bio_4 = 3.76425240065

selected variables are:
bio_1, bio_2, bio_3, bio_4
with as maximum VIF: 4.36471563878

Statistics are written to results.txt
</pre></div>

Run VIF for five variables, setting the maximum VIF at 10, and opt 
to retain the variable bio_5.

<div class="code"><pre>r.vif maps=bio_1,bio_2,bio_3,bio_4,bio_5 
maxvif=10 retain=bio_5 file=results.txt

VIF bio_1 = 76.6694778809
VIF bio_2 = 13.0044084945
VIF bio_3 = 5.30160850802
VIF bio_4 = 4.24765529428
VIF bio_5 = 96.27418889
VIF bio_2 = 2.11511290473
VIF bio_3 = 4.34705117783
VIF bio_4 = 3.83640053556
VIF bio_5 = 1.37949300873

selected variables are:
bio_2, bio_3, bio_4, bio_5
with as maximum VIF: 4.34705117783

Statistics are written to results.txt
</pre></div>

In the second example, the bio_5 variable is retained, and the 
variable bio_1, which has the next highest VIF, is removed. Note 
that the final VIF of the second example is in fact (slightly) 
lower, showing that default procedure may not always result in the 
lowest possible VIF.
