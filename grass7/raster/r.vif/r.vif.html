<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.vif</em> module computes a stepwise variance inflation factor 
(VIF) and the square root of the VIF. The VIF quantifies how much 
the variance (the square of the estimate's standard deviation) of an 
estimated regression coefficient is increased because of 
collinearity. The square root of VIF is a measure of how much larger 
the standard error is, compared with what it would be if that 
variable were uncorrelated with the other predictor variables in the 
model. 

<p>By default the VIF is calculated for each variable. If the user 
sets a VIF threshold value (maxvif) the VIF will be calculated again 
after removing the variable with the highest VIF. This will be 
repeated till the VIF is smaller than maxvif. This can thus be used 
to select a sub-set of variables for e.g., multiple regression 
analysis. 

<p>The user can optionally select one or more variables to be 
retained in the stepwise selection. For example, the user selects 
the variable <i>bio_5</i> to be retained. If in any step this 
variable has the highest VIF, the variable with the next highet VIF 
will be removed instead (see the examples).

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

The following examples are based on the nc_climate_spm_2000_2012
sample data set which you can download from
<a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/download/sample-data/">GRASS GIS sample
data download page</a>. This data set contains monthly rainfall and
temperature data for the years 2000 - 2012. In the examples below
the monthly data of 2000 is used. The analyses are run on a smaller
region, set below, to reduce the run time.

<div class="code"><pre>g.region n=226000 s=168500 w=229500 e=298500</pre></div>

<p>Example 1: Run VIF, setting the maximum VIF at 10. The function
will print the VIF computed at each step to the console. The same
will also be written to a text file. Below only the last part is
shown with the VIF values of the finally selected variables are
shown. The maximum VIF of 7.58 below is thus based on the R^2 of the
regression of 2011_07_precip against the other 5 selected variables.

<div class="code"><pre>MAPS=`g.list type=raster pattern=*2011*precip sep=,`
r.vif maps=$MAPS file=results1.txt maxvif=10

...
VIF 2011_01_precip = 4.24671728754
VIF 2011_04_precip = 5.22212300189
VIF 2011_05_precip = 4.86092882628
VIF 2011_06_precip = 7.12641548428
VIF 2011_07_precip = 7.5778242551
VIF 2011_08_precip = 3.3151772128

selected variables are:
2011_01_precip, 2011_04_precip, 2011_05_precip, 2011_06_precip,
2011_07_precip, 2011_08_precip
with as maximum VIF: 7.5778242551

Statistics are written to results1.txt
</pre></div>

<p>Example 2: Run the same VIF analysis as above, but this time tell
the function to retain the variable 2011_02_precip. The maximum VIF
of 9.72 below is based on the R^2 of the regression of
2011_06_precip against the other 6 selected variables.

<div class="code"><pre>MAPS=`g.list type=raster pattern=*2011*precip sep=,`
r.vif maps=$MAPS maxvif=10 retain=2011_02_precip file=results2.txt

...
VIF 2011_02_precip = 9.29298936882
VIF 2011_03_precip = 9.01810836159
VIF 2011_04_precip = 6.2991729186
VIF 2011_05_precip = 4.99445615367
VIF 2011_06_precip = 9.71883412866
VIF 2011_07_precip = 8.35889762858
VIF 2011_08_precip = 3.30091831548

selected variables are:
2011_02_precip, 2011_03_precip, 2011_04_precip, 2011_05_precip,
2011_06_precip, 2011_07_precip, 2011_08_precip
with as maximum VIF: 9.71883412866

Statistics are written to results2.txt
