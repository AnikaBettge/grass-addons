<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The module extracts portion of the input raster map according to the
current computational region. The areas outside of the computational
region are clipped and only the inner part is kept.

<p>
By default the cell size and the cell alignment of the original raster
is preserved. In other words, the output map inherits its resolution and
cell positions (grid) from the input raster rather than the
computational region.

<p>
If resampling into the cells size and cell alignment of the
current computational is desired, the module can perform a nearest
neighbor resampling when the <b>-r</b> flag is used.
If more advanced resampling is required, the user is advised to to use
one of the dedicated resampling modules.

<p>
If mask (<em><a href="r.mask.html">r.mask</a></em>) is active, it is
respected and the output raster map will contain NULL (no data) values
according to the mask.

<p>
The color table of the output raster map is set according to the
input raster map, so that the colors in both raster maps will match.
