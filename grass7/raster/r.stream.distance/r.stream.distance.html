<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<dl>

<dd>Outlets. Downstream method only. Calculate distance and relative elevation

ignoring nodes.</dd>

<dd>Subbasins. Downstream method only. Calculate distance and elevation to

<dd>Near. For upstream method only. Calculate distance and elevation to the

calculated to the farthest possible maximum/divide.

<dt><b>streams</b></dt>
<dd>Stream network: name of input stream map on which ordering will be performed,
produced by r.watershed or r.stream.extract. Because streams network produced by
r.watershed and r.stream.extract may slighty differ in detail it is required to
use both stream and direction map produced by the same module. Stream background
shall have NULL value or zero value. Background values of NULL are by default
produced by r.watershed and r.stream.extract. If not 0 or NULL use <a
href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a> to set background values to NULL.  
</dd>
<dt><b>dirs</b></dt>
<dd>Flow direction: name of input direction map produced by r.watershed or
r.stream.extract. If r.stream.extract output map is used, it only has non-NULL
values in places where streams occur. NULL (nodata) cells are ignored, zero and
negative values are valid direction data if they vary from -8 to 8 (CCW from
East in steps of 45 degrees). Direction map shall be of type CELL values. Region
resolution and map resoultion must be the same. Also <em>stream</em> network map
must have the same resolution. It is checked by default. If resolutions differ
the module informs about it and stops. Region boundary and maps boundary may
differ but it may lead to unexpected results.</dd>
<dt><b>elevation</b></dt>
<dd>Elevation: name of input elevation map. Map can be of type CELL, FCELL or
DCELL. It is not restricted to resolution of region settings as stream and

<dd>Returns elevation difference to the targer (outlet, node, stream, divide,

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
Module r.stream.distance may calculate distance using two methods: downstream
and upstream.
<p>
The default is downstream method when it calculates distance to streams and
outlets and relative elevation to streams and outlets. The distance and
elevation is calculated along watercourses. In outlets mode it can also
calculate parameters for subbasins.
<p>
In streams mode (default) it calculates that parameters downstream to streams
which are added as stream mask. In outlets mode there are some additional
possibilities. If subbasin is off it calculate parameters only for last point of
last (downstream) CELL. In subbasin mode it calculates parameters for every
subbasin separately. Subbasin mode acts similar to subbasin mask. Streams file
prepared to create basins and subbasins with r.stream.basins can be used to 
calculate distance and elevation parameters.
<p>
With upstream method it calculates distance to the local maximum or divide.
Opposite to downstream method, where every cell has one and only one downstream
cell in upstream method every cell has usually more than one upstream cell. So
it is impossible to determine interchangeable path from any cell. The upstream
method offers two alternative modes switched with -n flag: nearest local
maximum/divide:  means the shortest path to local maximum and default option
farthest maximum/divide means the longest path. In hydrological sense, nearest
mode means the shortest path which a particle of water must run from divide to
reach particular cell, while farthest mode means the possible longest path.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>
If there are more than one point or one stream network and some separate points
or separate streams networks are in catchment area defined by others it will
results as in subbasin mode. In stream mode subbasin options is ommited. Input
maps must be in CELL format (default output of r.watershed, r.stream.order and
r.stream.extract).
The distance are calculated in meters both for planimeters and
Latitude-Longitude projections. The distance is calculated for flat areas not
corrected by topography. Distance correction by topography may be done with
following r.mapcalc formula:
<p>
<code>echo 'dist_corrected = sqrt(distance^2 + elevation^2)' | r.mapcalc</code>
<p>
The module can work only if direction map, streams map and region have the same settings.
It is also required that streams map and direction map come from the same source.
For lots of reason this limitation probably cannot be omitted. This means that if
stream map comes from r.stream.extract also direction map from r.stream.extract
must be used. If stream network was generated with MFD method also MFD direction
map must be used.
<p>
Probably one of the most imortant features of r.stream.distance is the ability to
calculate distance not only for streams generated with r.stream.extract, but also
to any CELL map with resolution corresponding to dirs map. It can be a lake,
swamp, depression and lake boundaries even divided into smaller fragments each
with its own category.
