<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<em>r.green.hydro.recommended</em> detects the position of the potential hydropower plants including the legal constrains and the user's recommendations. Deciding the range of plant length, the distance between plants, the legal discharge we can exploit and the areas we want to exclude from the calculation (ex. protected areas and the ones according to user's recommendations), the module returns a vector file with the potential plants.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The difference between this module and r.green.hydro.optimal is that here we can consider a legal dicharge and add areas which will be deleted from the considered streams map used to compute the potential plants.<br> <br>

The input files are : <br> <br>

<blockquote>- the <b>rivers considered</b> (vector) on which the potential plants wille be computed<br><br>

- the <b>current discharge</b> (raster) for each point of these rivers. <br>
In the section Legal discharge, you can take into consideration the <b>Minimal Flow Discharge (MFD)</b>. It is the amount of water which has to remain in the river to preserve the ecosystems. There are three different ways to proceed which depend on the data you have :<br><br>

<blockquote>or the MFD can be considered as a percentage of the natural discharge, which is the discharge of the river without considering the structures exploiting the water. In this case, you have to give in input the percentage you want to consider and the raster map of the natural discharge. The discharge considered in the calculation will be the current discharge minus the MFD thus calculated.<br><br>

or you already have the raster map with the MFD. In this case, the discharge considered in the calculation will be the current discharge minus the MFD read in your input raster map. The module r.green.hydro.discharge can compute the raster map of the MFD according to the legislation of some regions.<br><br>

or you already have the raster map with the legal discharge. In this case, you can add this map as current discharge input and not use the parameters MFD and natural discharge.<br><br>

But for each case the raster map of the current discharge is a required input.</blockquote>

- the <b>areas to exclude</b> (vector). You can exclude some areas adding in input a vector map of them with or without a buffer around them. Only the rivers outside these excluded areas will be considered to compute the potential plants. There's also the possibility to add an input vector map with points of interest. Then, an area corresponding to the fields of vision from these points is computed, the latter correspond to visibility zones. You can choose to exclude these areas or the areas where several visibility zones are superimposed. The number of points for the visibility corresponds to the number of visibility zones which are superimposed. For example, if this number is 3, the areas where two or less visibility zones are superimposed will be excluded.<br><br>

- the <b>elevation</b> raster map, to calculate the gross head <br><br>

- the <b>range of plant length, distance between plants, minimum power and efficiency</b> (optional parameters)<br><br></blockquote>

The power is defined as :<br>

<center>P=&eta; * &rho; * g * Q * &Delta;h</center>

<blockquote>where &eta; is the efficiency of the plant <br>
&rho; the density of water (1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) <br>
g the gravity term (9,81 m/s<sup>2</sup>) <br>
Q the discharge of the river<br>
&Delta;h the gross head of the considered segment</blockquote><br>

The module maximizes the power over a given range by a brute-force search in order to examine all possible arrangements of Q and &Delta;h. Thus, the potential segments can be shorter than the maximum length plant chosen because it depends on the maximization of the product  Q * &Delta;h. For each potential segment, the potential power is given in kW in attribute.<br><br>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
This example is based on the case-study of Mis valley in Belluno province, Veneto, Italy.<br><br>

Here is the vector file availablestreams of the considered streams. The river segments already exploited by an existing plant do not appear in the file.<br>
In superimposition, there are the vector map (in grey) of the national park we want to exclude and the points of interest (in green) used to create the visibility zones. These points were placed according to experts' recommendations during a focus group made in Veneto region.

</center><br><br>

Points of interest are placed in the park so two different cases are presented here :<br>
1) The national park and a buffer of 200 m around it are excluded.<br>
2) The visibility zones from points of interest is excluded.<br><br>

<blockquote>1) In the first case, the code used is :<br>
<div class="code"><pre>r.green.hydro.recommended 
discharge_current=currentdischarge
discharge_natural=naturaldischarge
percentage=25.00
river=availablestreams 
elevation=elevation 
efficiency=0.8 
len_plant=400 
len_min=10 
distance=150 
area=nationalparks 
buff=200 
output_plant=potentialplants 
output_point=potentialpoints<br>
d.vect map= potentialpoints color=red<br>
d.vect map= potentialplants color=blue<br>
v.buffer input=nationalparks output=buff_park distance=200<br>
d.vect map= buff_park color=255:179:179 fill_color=255:179:179 width=1<br></pre></div><br>

This command calculates the energy potential for a range of plant length from 10 to 400 m and a distance between plants of 150 m. The areas with the national park and a buffer of 200 m around it are excluded. The discharge considered here is the current discharge of rivers subtracted by 25% of the natural discharge (the latter corresponds to the MFD).<br><br>

</center><br><br>

2) In the second case, the code used is :<br>
<div class="code"><pre>r.green.hydro.recommended 
discharge_current=currentdischarge 
mfd=mfd 
river=availablestreams 
elevation=elevation 
efficiency=0.8 
len_plant=400 
len_min=10 
distance=150 
points_view=pointsinterest 
n_points=1 
output_plant=potentialplants 
output_vis=vis 
output_point=potentialpoints<br>
d.vect map= potentialpoints color=red<br>
d.vect map= potentialplants color=blue<br>
d.vect map= pointsinterest color=green<br>
d.vect map= vis color=144:224:144 fill_color=144:224:144 width=1<br></pre></div><br>

This command calculates the energy potential for a plant length range from 10 to 400 m and a distance between plants of 150 m. The visibility zones from each point of interest are excluded. The discharge considered here is the current discharge of rivers subtracted by the MFD. The MFD was calculated previously and computed in a raster map.<br><br>
