<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The module r.green.gshp computes the Ground Source Heat Pump potential. <br>
It is composed of several programs considering different limits (e.g. theoretical, planning, technical, economic/finacial constraints).<br>

The module r.green.gshp consists of the following different parts:<br><br>

- <a href="r.green.gshp.theoretical.html">r.green.hydro.theoretical</a><br>
  calculates for each basin the theoretical maximum hydropower energy potential<br>
  input raster maps: &nbsp; &nbsp;- discharge along river network  &nbsp; &nbsp; - elevation of the considered region<br>  
  input vector map: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;existing plant position<br>
  output vector maps: - available river segments &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - optimal plant position<br><br>

- <a href="r.green.gshp.planning.html">r.green.hydro.recommended</a><br>
  detects the potential plant position considering legal and ecological constraints and the user's recommendations<br>
  input raster maps: &nbsp; &nbsp;- discharge along river network  &nbsp; &nbsp; - elevation of the considered region &nbsp; &nbsp; - minimum flow discharge<br>  
  input vector maps: &nbsp;&nbsp; - existing plant position  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-  areas excluded from calculation<br>
  output vector maps: - available river segments &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - optimal plant position<br><br>

- <a href="r.green.gshp.technical.html">r.green.hydro.technical</a><br>
  calculates the hydropower potential considering technical constrains (head losses, efficiency of turbine)<br>
  input vector map: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;intakes and restitutions of the potential plants<br>
  output vector map: &nbsp;- structure (derivation channel and penstock) on both sides of the river for each potential plant<br><br>

- <a href="r.green.gshp.financial.html">r.green.hydro.financial</a><br>
  computes the economic costs and values of the plants<br>
  input raster maps: &nbsp; &nbsp;- landuse  &nbsp; &nbsp; - slope<br>  
  input vector maps: &nbsp;&nbsp;- segments of the potential plants &nbsp;&nbsp;- plant structure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- electric grid<br>
  output vector map: &nbsp;&nbsp; structure of the potential plants with a re-organized table with e.g. power, gross head, total cost<br><br>
