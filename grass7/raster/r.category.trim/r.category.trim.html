<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>In GRASS you can 'cut out' a subset of a larger raster layer by 
setting the extent to something smaller then the extent of the 
original map using g.region and/or by setting a mask using r.mask, 
after which you simply run r.mapcalc "newmap = oldmap".

<p>You may have noticed that when creating the new map, all category 
category labels and colour table of the original map are copied over 
to the new map, even for category values that are not in the new 
map. If you are working with categorical maps, this may not be what 
you want. See <a href=
"https://pvanb.wordpress.com/2015/09/22/categorical-maps-and-legends/"
>here</a> for a more detailed discussion.

<p>With this addon you can trim the category and colour tables so it 
only contains category labels and colour definitions for the values 
present in the new map. You can do this on the input map, or do this 
on a copy of the map.

<p>If you prefer the map to have consecutive values (i.e., without 
gaps), there is the option to change the category values to a 
consecutive series by setting the n-flag. For example, if the map 
has the following categories values and labels (after the redundant 
category labels have been removed):

<div class="code"><pre>2 label2
5 label5
9 label9
</pre></div>

<p>Then the new recoded layer will have the category values and labels:

<div class="code"><pre>1 label2
2 label5
3 label9
</pre></div>

<p>Although it is possible to <a href= 
"https://pvanb.wordpress.com/2015/10/18/the-qgis-grass-plugin-is-back/
">open GRASS GIS raster layers directly in QGIS</a>, the legend in 
QGIS will show the right colours, but not the category labels. The 
addon let's you export the categories, category labels and colours 
as QGIS colour map file. This is just a simple text file with the 
raster categories and corresponding colour definitions and category 
labels. QGIS can use this to set the colour and labels for a raster 
layer. See <a href="https://pvanb.wordpress.com/?p=3650">this 
blogpost</a> for more details how to use the colour map file in 
QGIS. Alternatively, you can also export the categories and category 
labels in a normal csv file.


<h2>NOTE</h2>
The file is only useful for categorical maps. Therefore only integer maps are accepted as input.
