<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.modis.download</em> downloads selected MODIS products. The module
can download several tiles at once and also multiple observation days
for each MODIS product.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

To be able to download data the user needs a <em>user</em> and <em>password</em> 
provided by NASA. The user should register at <a href="https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new"
target="_blank">https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new</a>;
then login and move to his/her profile page. Once there, under 'My applications'
tab, the user needs to approve the following applications: 'LP DAAC Data Pool' 
and 'Earthdata Search'.
<p>
If the user is already registered, he/she just needs to login and enable the 
mentioned applications at <a href="https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home" target="_blank">https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home</a>
<p>
In order to download the desired product(s), the username and password must be
provided through the <em>settings</em> option. This There are two alternatives; 
either pass a file in which the first line is the username, usually 'anonymous' 
and, the second line is the password, usually the user's e-mail address, as below:
<div class="code"><pre>
  your_NASA_username
  your_NASA_password
</pre></div>
or, the user can pass the values from the standard input when prompted.
<p>

<b>Warning</b>: As per NASA policy no more than ten simultaneous connections
are permitted in parallel with their server. Hence, no more than ten processes
of <em>r.modis.download</em> should run at the same time to avoid that your
actual IP address gets blacklisted.
<p>
By default, the downloaded files are stored in the path where the settings
file is saved. The user can change this directory with the <em>folder</em>
option. The <em>folder</em> option is required when user and password are 
passed through the standard input.
<p>
The needed time for the download depends on the number of requested tiles, days
and the type of MODIS product. For example, the NDVI product ranges from 5 MB 
to 270 MB and the LST product ranges from 2 MB to 21 MB.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Download the daily MODIS LST product from the Terra satellite using the default
options (all available tiles from newest available date) and passing the user 
and password from standard input. Note that when settings is read from standard 
input, the option folder must be specified.
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download settings=- folder=/tmp 
</pre></div>

Reading the user and password options from a file. Images will be downloaded to
the folder where the SETTING file is.
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download settings=$HOME/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING
</pre></div>

Download LST Terra product using the default options and changing the starting
and ending dates to custom values.
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download settings=$HOME/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING startday=2011-05-01 endday=2011-05-31
</pre></div>

Download a different product (for example <em>Snow eight days 500 m</em>),
default options.
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download settings=$HOME/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING product=snow_terra_eight_500
</pre></div>

To use <em>r.modis.download</em> in a script and concatenate with another module,
the user needs to set the <em>-g</em> flag to return the name of the file that 
contains the list of downloaded HDF files:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download -g settings=$HOME/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING startday=2011-05-01 endday=2011-05-31
</pre></div>
