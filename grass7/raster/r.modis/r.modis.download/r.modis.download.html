<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.modis.download</em> downloads selected MODIS products. The module
can download several tiles at once and also multiple observation days
for each MODIS product.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<!-- isn't FTP outdated? Then remove here -->
The connection to the FTP data site requires a default login.
To set the username and password options the user has to use
the <em>setting</em> option; a file can be used (in this case the first
line is the username, usually it is 'anonymous', in the second line
the password is given, usually the user's e-mail address):
<div class="code"><pre>
  your_NASA_FTP_username
  your_NASA_FTP_password
</pre></div>
As an alternative, the user can pass the values from standard input.
<p>
Since 2013 NASA switched to the HTTP protocol for some of the MODIS repositories,
so the password it is no more necessary. If you are sure that for the product
of interest the HTTP protocol is used, you can skip to set the password.
<p>

<b>Warning</b>: As per NASA policy not more than ten simultaneous connections
are permitted in parallel with their server. Hence no more than ten processes
of <em>r.modis.download</em> should run at the same time to avoid that your
actual IP address gets blacklisted.
<p>
By default, the downloaded files are stored in the path where the setting
file is saved. The user can change this directory with <em>folder</em>
option. The user has to set the <em>folder</em> option if
user and password are sent by standard input.
<p>
The needed time for the download depends on the number of requested tiles, days
and the type of the MODIS product. For example, the NDVI product ranges 
from 5 MB to 270 MB and the LST product ranges from 2 MB to 21 MB.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

To download the MODIS LST product from the Terra satellite using the default
options and setting the user and password by standard input, launch:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download setting=-
</pre></div>

Reading the user and password options from file:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download setting=$HOME/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING
</pre></div>

To download LST Terra product using the default options and changing
the starting and ending dates to custom values:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download setting=$HOME/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING startday=2011-05-01 endday=2011-05-31
</pre></div>

To download another product (for example <em>Snow eight days 500 m</em>),
with other default options:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download setting=$HOME/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING product=snow_terra_eight_500
</pre></div>

To use <em>r.modis.download</em> in a script with one of the other module
the user has to set the <em>-g</em> flag to return the name of the file
containing a list of downloaded HDF names:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.modis.download -g setting=$HOME/.grass7/r.modis/SETTING startday=2011-05-01 endday=2011-05-31
</pre></div>
