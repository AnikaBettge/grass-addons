<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.modis.download</em> download MODIS products. It can download several tiles and days of each MODIS product.

<h2>NOTE</h2>

The first time that you use <em>r.modis</em> suite you have to do some easy operations to work corectly with <em>r.modis</em> modules.
<ul>
  <li>Create a r.modis folder inside $HOME/.grass7</li>
  <li>Create SETTING.py file inside $HOME/.grass7/r.modis and compile like below:
    <div class="code"><pre>
    #!/usr/bin/python

    USERNAME='your_NASA_FTP_username'
    PASSWORD='your_NASA_FTP_password'
    MRTPATH='your_path_to_MRT_software'
    </pre></div>
  </li>
</ul>

The username and password should not be required but it's better set them; the username is anonymous and password is your mail. Instead NASA FTP server it is open
<b>Warning</b>: NASA policy don't permit to open more then ten connections with the FTP servers. Please don't run more 10 the <em>r.modis.download</em> process at the same time.<br>
By default the data downladed are store in <em>$HOME/.grass7/r.modis/download/</em>; you can change the directory with <em>folder</em> options.<br>
The time of download change with the number of tiles, days and the type of product, for example NDVI product it is from 5 MB to 270 MB and LST is from 2 MB to 21 MB.

<h4>Products</h4>
The products already supported: 
<ul>
  <li>Land Surface Temperature daily (Terra): product provides per-pixel temperature and emissivity values in a sequence of swath-based to grid-based global products. The MODIS/Terra LST/E Daily L3 Global 1 km Grid product (MOD11A1), is tile-based and gridded in the Sinusoidal projection, and produced daily at 1 km spatial resolution. </li>
  <li>Land Surface Temperature daily (Aqua): product provides per-pixel temperature and emissivity values in a sequence of swath-based to grid-based global products. The MODIS/Aqua LST/E Daily L3 Global 1 Km Grid product (MYD11A1), is tile-based and gridded in the Sinusoidal projection, and produced daily at 1 Km spatial resolution.</li>
  <li>NDVI sixteen days (Terra): MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides continuity for time series historical applications. data are provided every 16 days at 250-meter spatial resolution as a gridded level-3 product (MOD13Q1) in the Sinusoidal projection.</li>
  <li>Snow eight days: </li>
</ul>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

To download LST Terra product using the default options (using $HOME/.grass7/r.modis/ as folder, SETTING.py file for username and password, starting from today until ten days ago) you can launch  
<div class="code"><pre>
    r.modis.download
</pre></div>

To download LST Terra product using the default options (using $HOME/.grass7/r.modis/ as folder, SETTING.py file for username and password) and change the starting and ending dates
<div class="code"><pre>
    r.modis.download startday=2011-05-31 endday=2011-05-01
</pre></div>

To downlad another product (for example <em>Snow eight days</em>), with other default options
<div class="code"><pre>
    r.modis.download product=snow_terra_eight
</pre></div>

To use username and password specified (note that the command
lines history will store the password in this way) and use the other default options
<div class="code"><pre>
    r.modis.download username=user password=*****
</pre></div>
