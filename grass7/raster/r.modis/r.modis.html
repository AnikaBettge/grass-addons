<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

The <em>r.modis</em> suite is a toolset to import MODIS satellite data in GRASS GIS. 
It uses the <a href="http://gis.cri.fmach.it/development/pyModis">pyModis</a>
library and the <a
href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac/tools/modis_reprojection_tool"> MODIS
Reprojection Tool</a> software to convert, mosaik and process MODIS data.
It requires the <a
href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/lpdaac/tools/modis_reprojection_tool">MODIS
Reprojection Tool</a> to be installed while <a
href="http://gis.cri.fmach.it/development/pyModis">pyModis</a> is
included in the <em>r.modis</em> suite.
The suite offers three modules as interface with MODIS data. Each modules
is dedicated to for a specific operation. The module <em>r.modis.download</em>
is used to download MODIS HDF products from NASA FTP. These files can then
be imported with <em>r.modis.import</em> which supports import of Level 3 
MODIS products as single image or daily mosaik into GRASS GIS.
<p>
The user can download several MODIS products, by single or multiple tiles and
also ranges of observation days retrieving data from the related NASA FTP server.
<!--
The suite process Level 2 data using the <em>r.modis.process</em> module.
-->
It imports Level 3 (georeferenced) products either as single image or as daily mosaik.

<h4>Products</h4>
The products already supported: 
<ul>
  <li><b>Land Surface Temperature daily 1 Km (Terra/Aqua)</b>: product provides per-pixel temperature
      and emissivity values in a sequence of swath-based to grid-based global products.
      The MODIS/Terra-Aqua LST/E Daily L3 Global 1 km Grid product (MOD11A1/MYD11A1), is tile-based 
      and gridded in the Sinusoidal projection, and produced daily at 1 km spatial resolution. </li>
  <li><b>Land Surface Temperature daily 6 Km (Terra/Aqua)</b>: data are composed from the daily 
      1-kilometer LST product (MOD11A1/MYD11A1) and stored on a 1-km Sinusoidal grid as the 
      average values of clear-sky LSTs during an 8-day period.<br>
      MOD11A2/MYD11A2 is comprised of daytime and nighttime LSTs, quality assessment, 
      observation times, view angles, bits of clear sky days and nights, and 
      emissivities estimated in Bands 31 and 32 from land cover types.</li>
  <li><b>Land Surface Temperature eight day 1 Km (Terra/Aqua)</b>: products provide per-pixel 
      temperature and emissivity values in a sequence of swath-based to grid-based 
      global products. The MODIS/Terra-Aqua LST/E Daily L3 Global 5 Km Grid 
      (Short name: MOD11B1/MYD11B1), is tile-based and gridded in the Sinusoidal projection, 
      and produced daily at 5 km spatial resolution.</li>
  <li><b>VI sixteen days 250 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: Global MODIS vegetation indices are designed 
      to provide consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation conditions. 
      Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 469-nanometers, 
      645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used to determine 
      the MODIS daily vegetation indices.<br>
      The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) complements NOAA's 
      Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI products and provides 
      continuity for time series historical applications. MODIS also includes a 
      new Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) that minimizes canopy background variations 
      and maintains sensitivity over dense vegetation conditions. The EVI also 
      uses the blue band to remove residual atmosphere contamination caused by 
      smoke and sub-pixel thin cloud clouds. The MODIS NDVI and EVI products are 
      computed from atmospherically corrected bi-directional surface reflectances 
      that have been masked for water, clouds, heavy aerosols, and cloud shadows.
      Global MOD13Q1/MYD13Q1 data are provided every 16 days at 250-meter spatial resolution 
      as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. Lacking a 250m 
      blue band, the EVI algorithm uses the 500m blue band to correct for residual 
      atmospheric effects, with negligible spatial artifacts.</li>
  <li><b>VI sixteen days 500 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: Global MODIS vegetation indices are 
      designed to provide consistent spatial and temporal comparisons of vegetation 
      conditions. Blue, red, and near-infrared reflectances, centered at 
      469-nanometers, 645-nanometers, and 858-nanometers, respectively, are used 
      to determine the MODIS daily vegetation indices.<br>

      Global MOD13A1/MYD13A1 data are provided every 16 days at 500-meter spatial 
      resolution as a gridded level-3 product in the Sinusoidal projection. 
      Vegetation indices are used for global monitoring of vegetation conditions 
      and are used in products displaying land cover and land cover changes. 
      These data may be used as input for modeling global biogeochemical and 
      hydrologic processes and global and regional climate. These data also may 
      be used for characterizing land surface biophysical properties and processes, 
      including primary production and land cover conversion.</li>
  <li><b>Snow eight days 500 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: The MOD10A2 and MYD10A2 products 
      are composites of eight days of snow maps in the sinusoidal grid.
      An eight-day compositing period was chosen because that is the exact ground 
      track repeat period of the Terra and Aqua platforms. Snow cover over eight 
      days is mapped as maximum snow extent in one SDS and as a chronology of 
      observations in the other SDS. Eight-day periods begin on the first day of 
      the year and extend into the next year. The product can be produced with 
      two to eight days of input. There may not always be eight days of input, 
      because of various reasons, so the user should check the attributes to 
      determine on what days observations were obtained. See the validation webpage 
      for details on the validation and validation definitions.</li>
  <li><b>Snow daily 500 m (Terra/Aqua)</b>: MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 are tiles of daily 
      snow cover at 500 m spatial resolution. The daily observation selected from 
      multiple observations in a MOD10A1 (or MYD10A1) cell is the observation 
      acquired nearest nadir and having the greatest coverage of the grid cell.
      The daily MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 snow products are tiles of data gridded in the 
      sinusoidal projection. Tiles are approximately 1200 x 1200 km in area. A 
      single scientific data set (SDS) of snow cover and a single SDS of QA data 
      along with local and global attributes comprise the data product file. The 
      daily level 3 snow product is the result of selecting an observation from 
      the multiple observations mapped to a cell of the MOD10_L2G (or MYD10_L2G) 
      product. See the validation webpage for details on the validation and 
      validation definitions.</li>
