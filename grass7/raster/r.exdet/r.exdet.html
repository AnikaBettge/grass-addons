<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) often involve some 
degree of projection into conditions non-analogous to those under 
which it has been calibrated. This projection into areas with novel 
environmental condtions is risky as it may be ecologically and 
statistically invalid. However, depending on the research question 
it may be difficult to avoid or indeed the objective of research to 
do so. An example is the prediction of potential distribution of 
species under future climates. The latter may include conditions 
hitherto not encountered in the area of interest. It is important to 
identify such areas and to interpret model results with care.

<p>The <em>r.exdet</em> function allows you to identify areas with
novel conditions, following methods developed by Mesgaran et al.
(2014) [1][2]. This includes areas where conditions fall outside the
range of values observed in the reference / callibration data set
(Type 1 novelty) or areas with novel combinations between the
envirionmental variables (Type 2 novelty). It furthermore compute
the most influential covariate (MIC; i.e., the most dissimilar
variable) for areas where conditions of at least one of the variables
fall outside the range of values observed in the reference data set.

<p>The type 1 (<em>NT1</em>) similarity is similar to how the 
multi-environmental similarity messure (MESS) computes novel 
climates [3]. In both cases if a point is outside the range of a 
given covariate, it gets a negative value based on its distance to 
the minimum/maximum of that covariate. The difference is that the 
MESS is based on the most negative value amongst these covariates. 
The NT1 on the other hand is the sum of all these distances. The NT1 
thus accounts for all variables [2]. The <em>NT1</em> can have 
infinite negative values to zero where zero indicates no 
extrapolation beyond the univariate coverage of reference data.

<p>The type 2 (<em>NT2</em>) similarity is based on the Mahalanobis 
distance and is used to identify areas where conditions are within 
the range of univariate variation but which exhibits novel 
combinations between covariates. <em>NT2</em> can range from zero up 
to infinite positive values. Values ranging from 0 to 1 indicate 
similarity (in terms of both univariate range and multivariate 
combination), with values closer to zero being more similar. Values 
larger than one are indicative of novel combinations.[1]

<p>The function essentially compares the environmental conditions in 
one area (the reference set) with those of another area (the 
projected set). For the reference set, the function respects the 
region and the mask, if any. The projection data can be of the same 
region (e.g., when comparing current and future climates; see 
example 1 below), or another region (e.g., when comparing conditions 
in one country with those in another country; see example 2 below). 
In the second case, the projected data can be defined by raster 
layers covering a different region. One can also use a 
<a href="http://grass.osgeo.org/grass64/manuals/g.region.html">region</a>
to define the projected area (see example 3 below).

<h3>Example 2</h3>

You can download a sample data set from <a href=
"http://www.climond.org/ExDet.aspx">http://www.climond.org/ExDet</a>. 
The sample data contains 4 clipped Bioclim variable layers for 
Australia and South Africa sourced from the CliMond dataset. In this 
example we will use the Australia data as reference and the South 
Africa data as projected or test. In the example below I will assume 
you have downloaded the data and imported it in the currently open 
location/mapset (the coordinate system is latlon, EPSG 4326).
