<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<i>r.terrain.texture </i>calculates the Terrain Surface Texture of
Iwahashi and Pike (2007). The calculation measures the frequency of peaks and
pits in a DEM over a user specified window size. In practice, this measure
represents terrain 'texture' or 'grain'.

<p>
The calculation attempts to follow the description in Iwahashi and Pike
(2007). Pits and peaks are firstly identified in the DEM by passing the
DEM through a median filter with a 3x3 neighbourhood, and the pits and
peaks are identified based on the difference between this smoothed DEM
and the original terrain surface. By default, the algorithm uses a
threshold of zero (i.e., any difference is identified as a pit or
peak), however a user specified 'flatness' threshold can also be
specified.

The final terrain surface texture calculation involves <i>r.neighbors</i> to
count the number of pits and peaks occurring within a user specified window
size (default is 21 x 21, as per Iwahashi and Pike (2007)), and then this
is converted into a percentage.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<i>r.terrain.texture</i> performs best when using larger window sizes, either
21 x 21 or 11 x 11 represent reasonable parameters. 

<h2>TODO</h2>
The same approach was also used by Iwahashi and Pike (2007) to calculate
terrain surface convexity, but using convexities and concavities rather
than pits and peaks. The ability to calculate this will be implemented in
the future. Also, these two morphometric variables can serve as a basis
to classify the landscape into generic geomorphic categories.
