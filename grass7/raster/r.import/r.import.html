<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.import</em> imports selected bands from a GDAL raster datasouce 
into the current location and mapset. If the projection of the input 
does not match the projection of the location, the input is reprojected 
into the current location. If the projection of the input does match 
the projection of the location, the input is imported directly with <a 
href="r.in.gdal.html">r.in.gdal</a>.

<h4>Resolution</h4>
<em>r.import</em> reports the estimated target resolution for each 
input band. The estimated resolution will usually be some floating 
point number, e.g. 271.301. The target resolution should be the rounded 
estimated resolution, e.g. 250 or 300 instead of 271.301. For latlong 
locations, the resolution might be set to arc seconds, e.g. 1, 3, 7.5, 
15, and 30 arc seconds are commonly used resolutions.

<h4>Resampling methods</h4>
<b>nearest</b> is the simplest method and the only possible method for 
categorical data.
<p>
<b>bilinear</b> does linear interpolation and provides smoother output 
than <b>nearest</b>. <b>bilinear</b> is recommended when reprojecting a 
DEM for hydrological analysis or for surfaces where overshoots must be 
avoided, e.g. precipitation should not become negative. 
<p> 
<b>bicubic</b> produces smoother output than <b>bilinear</b>, at 
the cost of overshoots. 
<p>
<b>lanczos</b> produces the smoothest output of all methods and 
preserves contrast best. <b>lanczos</b> is recommended for imagery. 
Both <b>bicubic</b> and <b>lanczos</b> preserve linear features. With 
<b>nearest</b> or <b>bilinear</b>, linear features can become zigzag 
features after reprojection.
