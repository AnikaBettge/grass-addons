<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.forestfrag</em> Computes the forest fragmentation following 
the methodology proposed by Riitters et. al (2000). See 
<a href="http://www.consecol.org/vol4/iss2/art3/">this article</a> for a 
detailed explanation.

<p>It follows a "sliding window" algorithm with overlapping windows. 
The amount of forest and its occurence as adjacent forest pixels 
within fixed- area "moving-windows" surrounding each forest pixel is 
measured. The window size is user-defined. The result is stored at 
the location of the center pixel. Thus, a pixel value in the derived 
map refers to "between-pixel" fragmentation around the corresponding 
forest location.

<p>Let <em>Pf</em> be the proportion of pixels in the window that 
are forested. Define <em>Pff</em> (strictly) as the proportion of 
all adjacent (cardinal directions only) pixel pairs that include at 
least one forest pixel, for which both pixels are forested. <em>Pff</em>
 thus (roughly) estimates the conditional probability that, 
given a pixel of forest, its neighbor is also forest. The 
classification model identifies six fragmentation categories: 

<div class="code"><pre>
interior:       Pf = 1.0
patch:          Pf < 0.4
transitional:   0.4 &le; Pf < 0.6
edge:           Pf &ge; 0.6 and Pf - Pff < 0
perforated:     Pf &ge; 0.6 and Pf - Pff > 0
undetermined:   Pf &ge; 0.6 and Pf = Pff
</pre></div>

<h2>NOTES</h2> 

<ul>
<li>The moving window size is user-defined (default=3) 
and must be an odd number. If an even number is given the function 
will stop with an error message.
<li>To avoid edge effects at the border of the raster layer the user 
can choose to have the output raster trimmed with a number of raster 
cells equal to 1/2 * the size of the moving window. 
<li>The function respects the region. The user has however the option 
to set the region to match the input layer.
</ul>

This addon is based on the 
<a href="http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/AddOns/GRASS_6#r.forestfrag>">r.forestfrag.sh</a> 
script, with as extra options user-defined moving window size, 
option to trim the region (by default it respects the region).
