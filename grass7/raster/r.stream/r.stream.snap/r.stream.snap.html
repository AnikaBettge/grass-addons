<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<DL>
<DT><b>streams</b></DT>
<DD>Stream network created by r.stream.extract or r.watershed. If used, points are snapped to the nearest streamline point which accumulation is grater than treshold. If accumulation is not used point is snapped to the nearest stream. </DD>

<DT><b>accum</b></DT>
<DD>Accumulation map created with r.waterhed and used to genearte stream network with r.stream.extract. If stream network is not in use, point is adaptively snapped to the to point where value is greater than mean values of accumulation grater than given treshold in a searcyh radius. See description for details.
</DD>
<DT><b>radius</b></DT>
<DD>Search radius (in cells). If there are no streams in search radius, point is not snapped. If there are no cells with accumulation grater than accumtreshold point also is not snapped.
</DD>

<DT><b>accumtres</b></DT>
<DD>Minimum value of accumulation which cell must have to snap point. This option is added to snap stream inits to the stream tubes and to distinguish between local tributuaries and main streams.
</DD>

<DT><b>input</b></DT>
<DD>Vector file containing outlets or inits as vector points. Only point's categories are used Table attached to it is ignored. Every point shall heve his own unique category.
</DD>
</DL>


<h2>OUTPUTS</h2>
<P>Vector file containing outlets or inits after snapping. On layer 1 oryginal categories are preserved, on layer 2 there are four categories which mean:</p>
<ol>
<li>skipped (not in use yet)
<li>unresolved (points remain unsnapped due to lack of streams in search radius
<li>snapped (points snapped to streamlines)
<li>correct (points whcich remain on its original position, wchich was originally corected
</ol>



<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<P>
Module r.stream.snap is a suplementary module for r.stream.extract and r.stream.basins to correct position of outlets or stream init points as they do not lie on the streamliens.
<BR>
For outlets situation is clear. Points are snapped to nearest point whcich lies on the streamline. In situaltion where there can be a small tributuary nearer than main stream accumulation treshold shall be high enough to force program ignoring this tributuary and snap to the main stream. If there is no accumulation map points will be snapped to nearest stream line whcich in particular situation may be wrong. Bacuase r.stream is perepared to work with MFD accum maps, both stream network and accum map is neccesary to resolve the problem.
<BR>
While it is assumed accum map is a MFD map, if stream network is not supplied, snap point is calculated in different way: treshold is used to select only these points in search radius wchich are accum value is greater than treshold. Next mean value of these points is calculated and its value is taken as a new treshold. This procedure guarantee that points are snapped to the center of stream tube. While for inits small tresholds are in use, it is probable than points were snapped to the streamtube border instead of its center. 
</p>
<p>
It is strongly recommended, to use both stream network (even pre-genearted with small accum treshold) and accumulation map, than accum or stream map only.
