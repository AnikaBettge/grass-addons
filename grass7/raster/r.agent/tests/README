README file for libagent's test suite

This test cases are intended to contain all the tests for
libagent and to be usable with python 2.7 and higher, resp.
also via the separate unittest2 available as backport for python
2.3-2.6 too. At the moment I am working on a 2.6er system but
e.g. by adapting the respective imports I expect it to work
on 2.7 too..

To invoke e.g. the error tests only, from the topmost directory
level (i.e. r.agent) issue
 user@py2.6host:~/r.agent$ unit2 discover -v -p "test_error.py"
or
 user@py2.7host:~/r.agent$ unittest discover -v -p "test_error.py"
respectively (consult "-h" for help).
