<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Module <em>r.stream.basins</em> is prepared to delineate basins and 
subbasins with different input data. Module is prepared to delineate 
unrestricted number of basins in one step. It can delineate basins 
with three methods:

<ul>
<li>Using coordinates: this option simply copies functionality of
    <a href="r.water.outlet.html">r.water.outlet</a>.
<li>Using vector points: it allow to manually point outlets with any method
<li>Using streams (most advanced) it allow on lots of modifications. See
examples for more details.
</ul>

Only one method can be used at once. Methods cannot be mixed.
<p>
The most recommended method requires two maps: direction and 
streams. In spite of stream map we can store information required to 
proper delineation, we can also enumerate stream categories for 
which basins are to be created (cats option). Module is prepared to 
work with output data of <em>r.watershed</em>, <em>r.stream.extract</em>,
<em>r.stream.order</em> also with modification done by
<em>r.reclass</em> and <em>r.mapcalc</em>. r.stream.basin can delineate 
basins according outlets marked by raster streams, and polygons, 
vector points and numerical coordinates. If outlets are marked by 
points or coordinates it delineates basins which cells contribute to 
that points, if outlets are marked by streams it delineate cells 
which contribute to the last (downstream) cell of the every stream. 
If outlets are marked by polygon it delineate cells contributing to 
most downstream cell of the polygon. If polygon covers more outlets 
than of one basins it will create collective basin for all outlets  
with common category.

<h2>OPTIONS</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>-z</b></dt>
<dd>Creates zero-value background instead of NULL. For some reason (like map
algebra calculation) zero-valued background may be required. This flag produces
zero-filled background instead of NULL (default).</dd>
<dt><b>-c</b></dt>
<dd>By default <em>r.stream.basins</em> uses streams category as basin category. In some
cases - for example if stream map is a product of map algebra and separate streams
may not have unique values this option will create a new category sequence for
each basin (do not work in vector point mode).
</dd>
<dt><b>-l</b></dt>
<dd>By default r.stream.basins create basins for all unique streams. This option
delineate basins only for last streams ignoring upstreams (do not work in vector
point mode).
</dd>

<dt><b>direction</b></dt>
<dd> Flow direction: name of input direction map produced by
<em>r.watershed</em> or <em>r.stream.extract</em>. If <em>
r.stream.extract</em> output map is used, it only has non-NULL 
values in places where streams occur. NULL (nodata) cells are 
ignored, zero and negative values are valid direction data if they 
vary from -8 to 8 (CCW from East in steps of 45 degrees). Direction 
map shall be of type CELL values. Region resolution and map 
resolution must be the same.
Also <em>stream</em> network map (if used) and direction map must 
have the same resolution. It is checked by default. If resolutions 
differ the module informs about it and stops. Region boundary and 
maps boundary may be differ but it may lead to unexpected results.
</dd>

<dt><b>coors</b></dt>
<dd>East and north coordinates for basin outlet. It can delineate only
one basin using that option. This option simply copies functionality of
<a href="r.water.outlet.html">r.water.outlet</a>.
</dd>
<dt><b>stream_rast</b></dt>
<dd>Stream network: name of input stream map on which ordering will 
be performed produced by <em>r.watershed</em> or <em>r.stream.extract</em>.
Because streams network produced by <em>r.watershed</em> and 
<em>r.stream.extract</em> may slightly differ in detail, it is 
required to use both stream and direction map produced by the same 
module. Stream background shall have NULL value or zero value. 
Background values of NULL are by default produced by <em>r.watershed</em>
and <em>r.stream.extract</em>. If not 0 or NULL use
<a href="r.mapcalc.html">r.mapcalc</a> to set background values to null. </dd>

<dt><b>cats</b></dt>
<dd>Stream categories to delineate basins for: All categories which are not in
stream map are ignored. It can be used with stream network created by
<em>r.watershed</em>, <em>r.stream.extract</em> or <em>r.stream.order</em>.
For <em>r.stream.order</em> use category of order for which basins must
be created. For example to delineate only basins for order two use <b>cats=2</b>.
If you need unique category for every basin use <b>-c</b> flag.
</dd>

<dt><b>points</b></dt>
<dd>Vector file containing basins outlet as vector points. Only point's
categories are used to prepare basins. Attached table attached is ignored. Every
point shall have his own unique category. In that mode flags <b>-l</b> and
<b>-c</b> are ignored.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>OUTPUTS</h2>
<p>The module produces one raster map with basins according user's rules</p>

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<p>
To receive good results outlets markers created by user shall overlapping with
streams. On the other way basins could results with very small area. Input maps
must be in CELL format (default output of <em>r.watershed</em>, 
<em>r.stream.order</em> or <em>r.stream.extract</em>).
<p>
Module can work only if direction map, stream map and region map has same
settings. It is also required that stream map and direction map come from the
same source. For lots of reason this limitation probably cannot be omitted.  
This means, if stream map comes from r.stream.extract, also direction map from
<em>r.stream.extract</em> must be used. If stream network was generated
with MFD method, also MFD direction map must be used. Nowadays, if direction
map comes from <em>r.stream.extract</em>, it must be patched by direction
map from <em>r.watershed</em>. (with <em>r.patch</em>). 

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
<p>
To delineate all basins with categories of streams:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins direction=direction stream_rast=streams basins=bas_basins_elem
</pre></div>
To determine major and minor basins in area, defined by outlets, ignoring
subbasins use  - l flag. That flag ignores all nodes and uses only real outlets
(in most cases that on map border):
<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins -l direction=direction stream_rast=streams basins=bas_basins_last

r.stream.basins direction=direction coors=639936.623832,216939.836449
</pre></div>

<p>
To delineate one or more particular basins defined by given streams, add simply
stream categories:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins -lc direction=direction stream_rast=streams cats=2,7,184 basins=bas_basin
</pre></div>

<p>
Do delineate basins of particular order we must use the following procedure: 

<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins -lc direction=direction stream_rast=strahler cats=2 \
         basins=bas_basin_strahler_2
</pre></div>

<p>
The usage of polygons as outlets markers is very useful when exact stream course
cannot be clearly determined before running analysis, but the area of its
occurrence can be determined (mostly in iterative simulations) Example uses
<em>r.circle</em> but can be substituted by any polygon created for example  with
<em>v.digit</em>:
<div class="code"><pre>
r.circle -b output=circle coordinate=639936.623832,216939.836449 max=200
r.stream.basins -c direction=direction streams=circle basins=bas_simul
</pre></div>
<p>
To determine areas of contribution to streams of particular order  use as
streams the result of ordering:
<p>
<div class="code"><pre>
r.stream.basins direction=direction stream_rast=ord_strahler basins=bas_basin_strahler
</pre></div>
<p>
Determination of areas of potential source of pollution. The example will be
done for lake marked with FULL_HYDR 8056 in North Carolina sample dataset. The
lake shall be extracted and converted to binary raster map.

<div class="code"><pre>
v.extract -d input=lakes@PERMANENT output=lake8056 type=area layer=1 \
  where='FULL_HYDRO = 8056' new=-1 
v.to.rast input=lake8056 output=lake8056 use=val type=area layer=1 value=1
r.stream.basins direction=direction streams=lake8056 basins=bas_basin_lake
</pre></div>
