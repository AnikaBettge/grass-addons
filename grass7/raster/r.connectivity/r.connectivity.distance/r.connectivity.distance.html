<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<em>r.connectivity.distance</em> computes cost-distance between all 
areas (patches) of an input vector map within a user defined euclidean 
distance threshold.

<p>Recently, graph-theory has been characterised as an efficient and 
useful tool for conservation planning (e.g. Bunn et al. 2000, 
Calabrese & Fagan 2004, Minor & Urban 2008, Zetterberg et. al. 2010).</p>

<p>As a part of the r.connectivity.* tool-chain, <em>r.connectivity.distance</em> is 
intended to make graph-theory more easily available to conservation 
planning.</p>

<p><em>r.connectivity.distance</em> is the first tool of the 
r.connectivity.*-toolchain (followed by <em>r.connectivity.network</em> 
and <em>r.connectivity.corridors</em>).</p>

<p><em>r.connectivity.distance</em> loops through all polygons in the 
input vector map and calculates the cost-distance to all the other 
polygons within a user-defined defined euclidean distance threshold.</p>

<p>It produces two vector maps that holde the network:</p>
<ul>
<li>an edge-map (connections between patches) and a</li>
<li>vertex-map (centroid representations of the patches).</li>
</ul>

<p>Attributes of the edge-map are:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td>cat</td>
  <td>line category</td>
  <td>integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>from_patch</td>
  <td>category of the start patch</td>
  <td>integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>to_patch</td>
  <td>category of the destination patch</td>
  <td>integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>dist</td>
  <td>cost-distance from from_patch to to_patch</td>
  <td>double precision</td>
</tr>

</table>
<p>Attributes of the vertex-map are:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <td>cat</td>
  <td>category of the input patches</td>
  <td>integer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>pop_proxy</td>
  <td>the user defined population proxy to be used in further analysis, 
representing a proxy for the amount of organisms potentially dispersing 
from a patch (e.g. habitat area)</td>
  <td>double precision</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>On user request (<b>p-flag</b>) the shortest paths between the possible 
combination of patches can be extracted (using <em>r.drain</em>), along 
with start and stop points.</p>

<p>In addition, <em>r.connectivity.distance</em> outputs a cost distance 
raster map for every input area which later on are used in 
<em>r.connectivity.corridors</em> (together with output from 
<em>r.connectivity.network</em>) for corridor identification.</p>

<p>Distance between patches is measured as border to border distance. With 
the <b>border_dist</b> option, the user can define the number of cells 
(n) along the border to be used for distance measuring.<br>
The distance from a (start) patch to another (end) is measured as the 
n-th closest cell on the border of the other (end) patch. An increased 
number of border cells used for distance measuring increases also the 
width of possible corridors computed with 
<em>r.connectivity.corridors</em> later on.</p>

<p>If an output directory is given for the <b>conefor_dir</b> option is 
specified, also output suitable for further processing in 
<a href="http://www.conefor.org">CONEFOR</a> will be produced, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>a node file</li>
<li>a directed connection file, and</li>
<li>an undirected connection file</li>
</ul>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
The following example is based on the North Carolina dataset!
<p><em>Please be aware that all input parameter of the following example are 
purely hypothetical (though they intend to imitate a real life 
situation) and chosen only for the matter of the exercise. Parameters 
have to be adjusted in other cases according to ecological knowledge in 
order to give meaningful results!</em></p>

<p>
Let us assume we want to analyse the habitat connectivity for a 
hypothetical species of the Hardwood Swamps in North Carolina. This 
species lives only in the larger core area of the swamps (> 1ha) while 
the borders are no suitable habitats.<br>
It is not the most mobile of species and can cover (under optimal 
conditions) maximal 1.5 km.
</p>

<h3>Prepare input data</h3>
Befor we can run the connectivity analysis with the r.connectivity.*-tools 
we need to prepare the the example input data. Because we want to use 
cost distance as a distance measure we have to provide a cost raster map 
in addition to the required vector map of (habitat) patches:

<h3>Create input patch vector map</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
### Set region
g.region -p rast=landuse96_28m align=landuse96_28m

### Patch input vector map
## Extract habitat patches
# Condition 1: Category 11 = Bottomland Hardwoods/Hardwood Swamps
# Condition 2: no border-cells are suitable  
r.mapcalc expression="patches=if( \
landuse96_28m[0,1]==11&& \
landuse96_28m[0,-1]==11&& \
landuse96_28m[1,1]==11&& \
landuse96_28m[1,0]==11&& \
landuse96_28m[1,-1]==11&& \
landuse96_28m[-1,1]==11&& \
landuse96_28m[-1,0]==11&& \
landuse96_28m[-1,-1]==11&& \
landuse96_28m==11,1,null())"

# Vectorize patches
r.to.vect input=patches output=patches feature=area

# Add a column for the population proxy (in this case area in hectares)
v.db.addcolumn map=patches layer=1 columns="area_ha double precision"

# Upload area to attribute table (later used as population proxy)
v.to.db map=patches type=point,line,boundary,centroid layer=1 qlayer=1 \
option=area units=hectares columns=area_ha

#Extract core habitat areas with more than 1 ha
v.extract input=patches output=patches_1ha type=area layer=1 where="area_ha>1"

<h3>Create a cost raster:</h3>
(see also: <em>r.cost</em>)

<p>For the cost raster, we assume that areas which are developed with 
high intensity are absolute barriers for our species (not crossable at all).<br>
Other developed and managed areas can be crossed, but only at high costs 
(they are avoided where possible). Other Hardwood landcover types offer 
best opportnity for the dispersal of our species (they are prefered), 
while the costs for crossing the other landcover types is somewhere 
inbetween.</p>
<p>Hint: One might also add infrastructure like e.g. roads</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
# Reclassify land use map
# Windows users may have to use the GUI version of r.reclass
# and paste the rules there...
echo '0 = 56 #not classified (2*resolution (28m))
1 = NULL #High Intensity Developed (absolut barrier)
2 = 140 #Low Intensity Developed (5*resolution (28m))
3 = 112 #Cultivated (4*resolution (28m))
4 = 70 #Managed Herbaceous Cover (2,5*resolution (28m))
6 = 28 #Riverine/Estuarine Herbaceous (1*resolution (28m))

<h3>Create the network</h3>
In the first step the network dataset is created, and the cost distance 
between all possible pairs of vertices (patches) is calculated.
<p>Our species is known to be uable to cover more than 1.5 km distance. 
In order to identify potential for improving the connectectivity of the 
landscape for our speies we set the cutoff distance (maximum search 
distance for connections) to three times dispersal potential of our 
species (4500). In lack of real population data we use the area (ha) as 
a proxy. The distance between two patches is measured as the maximum 
distance along the closest 500m of boundary of a patch (ca. 18 border 
cells with 28m resolution). We store the resulting network data also 
in a format that is suitable as input to CONEFOR software.</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
r.connectivity.distance -t -p input=patches_1ha pop_proxy=area_ha \
costs=costs prefix=hws_connectivity cutoff=4500 border_dist=18 \
conefor_dir=./conefor

<p>To be continued with <a href="r.connectivity.network.html">
	r.connectivity.network</a>!</p>

<h3>Analyse the network (r.connectivity.network)</h3>

In the next step network analysis is performed. We define the 
connectivity cutoff (maximum cost distance where connectivity is assumed) 
to be 1500.0 cost distance units, which represents the maximum known 
dispersal ability of our species. The dispersal kernel is adjusted to 
characteristics of this species by setting the exponent to -3, which 
gives a steeper decrease in successful dispersal with increasing cost 
distance. Only very few dispersal units of our species are expected to 
cross more than ca. 900 cost distance units successfully 
(see: ./hws_connectivity/kernel.eps after running the command or run it 
with the x-flag (-x) for only displaying the kernel). Connectivity metrics 
reslults are stored in te attribute table of the vector maps on vertex 
(patches, map name: "prefix" _ vertex_measures) and edge level 
(connections, map name: "prefix" _ edge_measures). An overview over 
connectivity metrics on the graph level (the entire network) is stored 
in "folder" (./hws_connectivity). We requested also an R-plot of the 
dispersal kernel and an R-plot givig an overview over network 
characteristics to be stored in the same folder.
<p>Users with a multi-processor computer may speed up processing by 
setting cores > 1 in r.connectivity.network.</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
r.connectivity.network -y -i folder=./hws_connectivity \
connectivity_cutoff=1500.0 lnbh_cutoff=2.0 cl_thres=10 exponent=-3 \
kernel_plot=./hws_connectivity/kernel.eps \
overview_plot=./hws_connectivity/overview.eps cores=3
</pre></div>

<h3>Calculate corridors (r.connectivity.corridors)</h3>

In this example two alternative (or to some extent complementary) sets \
of corridors are calculated:
<p>
<em>Corridor set 1:</em><br>
For the first set, corridors are only computed for the minimum spanning 
tree (in literture sometimes called the backbone of an ecological network). 
This is specified in the "where"-parameter. Edge betweenness values are 
used as weights, which represent the centrality of a connection (edge) 
in a network (and is therewith a measure of importance). The output is a 
set of corridor raster maps (named: "prefix" _corridor_ "edge_id" _ "weight") 
and a summary over all computed corridors 
(named: "prefix" _corridor_ "edge_id" _ "weight" _sum_ "suffix").</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
r.connectivity.corridors --verbose folder=./hws_connectivity suffix=mst \
weights=cf_eb_ud where="cf_mst_ud > 1" cores=3
</pre></div>

<p><em>Corridor set 2:</em><br>
For the second set, corridors are computed for all edges in the graph (network). 
This takes a little more time. Corridors are then weighted by the modeled, 
undirected (= in oth directions) flow of propagules ("cf_u").</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
r.connectivity.corridors --verbose folder=./hws_connectivity suffix=alle \
weights=cf_u cores=3
</pre></div>

<p>Users with a multi-processor computer may speed up corridor processing by 
setting cores > 1 r.connectivity.corridors.<br>
An other means for speeding up processing would be to use integer 
weights (e.g. by converting edge betweenness to integer afte multiplying 
with 10 to the power of the relevant number of digits).
Then <em>r.reclass</em> is used in the script instead of <em>r.recode</em>.</p>

<p>When all analysis is finnished some cleanup may be appropriate, 
in order to save disk space:</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
#Add the f-lag (-f) to the following two commands if you are sure you \
want to delete all intermediate maps from r.connectivity.*.
g.remove type=raster pattern=hws_connectivity_corridor_*
g.remove type=raster pattern=hws_connectivity_patch_*
</pre></div>
