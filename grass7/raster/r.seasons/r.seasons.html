<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.seasons</em> counts the number of seasons in a time series. A 
season is defined as a time period of at least <em>min</em> length 
where no value is below <em>threshold</em> (with the <em>-l</em> flag, 
no value above <em>threshold</em>).

<p>
The <em>nout</em> output holds the number of detected seasons. Output 
raster maps with the start and end dates of each season are produced 
for at most <em>n</em> number of seasons. For each season, two start 
dates and two end dates are determined. The start date start1 and the 
end date end1 indicate the start and end of the core season, while the 
start date start2 and the end date end2 indicate the start and end of 
the full season including some gaps at the beginning and end of the 
season. Gaps are shorter than <em>min</em>, that is, a season will not 
include gaps equal or longer than <em>min</em>.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The maximum number of raster maps that can be processed is given by the 
per-user limit of the operating system. For example, the soft limits 
for users are typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. 
<tt>ulimit -n 4096</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but not higher 
than the hard limit. If it is too low, you can as superuser add an 
entry in

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          4096
</pre></div>

This would raise the hard limit to 4096 files. Also have a look at the 
overall limit of the operating system
<div class="code"><pre>
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</pre></div>
which is on modern Linux systems several 100,000 files.

<p>Use the <em>-z</em> flag to analyze large amount of raster maps 
without hitting open files limit and the size limit of command line 
arguments. This will however increase the processing time. For every 
single row in the output map(s) all input maps are opened and closed. 
The amount of RAM will rise linear with the number of specified input 
maps.
<p>
The input and file options are mutually exclusive. Input is a 
text file with a new line separated list of raster map names.
