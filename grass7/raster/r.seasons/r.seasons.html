<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.seasons</em> counts the number of seasons in a time series. A 
season is defined as a time period of at least <em>min_length</em> 
length where no value is below <em>threshold</em> (with the <em>-l</em> 
flag, no value above <em>threshold</em>).

<p>
The <em>nout</em> output holds the number of detected seasons. Output 
raster maps with the start and end dates of each season are produced 
for at most <em>n</em> number of seasons.

<p>
For each season, two start dates and two end dates are determined. The 
start date start1 and the end date end1 indicate the start and end of 
the core season, while the start date start2 and the end date end2 
indicate the start and end of the full season including some gaps at 
the beginning and end of the season. Gaps are shorter than 
<em>max_gap</em>, that is, a season will not include gaps equal or 
longer than <em>max_gap</em>.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The maximum number of raster maps that can be processed is given by the 
per-user limit of the operating system. For example, the soft limits 
for users are typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. 
<tt>ulimit -n 4096</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but not higher 
than the hard limit. If it is too low, you can as superuser add an 
entry in

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          4096
</pre></div>

This would raise the hard limit to 4096 files. Also have a look at the 
overall limit of the operating system
<div class="code"><pre>
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</pre></div>
which is on modern Linux systems several 100,000 files.

<p>Use the <em>-z</em> flag to analyze large amount of raster maps 
without hitting open files limit and the size limit of command line 
arguments. This will however increase the processing time. For every 
single row in the output map(s) all input maps are opened and closed. 
The amount of RAM will rise linear with the number of specified input 
maps.
<p>
The input and file options are mutually exclusive. Input is a 
text file with a new line separated list of raster map names.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Determine occurrence/number of seasons with their respective start and end
dates (in the form of map indexes) in global NDVI data. Let's use the example
from <em>r.modis.import</em> to download and import NDVI global data and,
create a time series with it:

<div class="code"><pre>
# download two years of data: MOD13C1, global NDVI, 16-days, 5600 m
r.modis.download settings=~/.rmodis product=ndvi_terra_sixteen_5600 \
  startday=2015-01-01 endday=2016-12-31 folder=$USER/data/ndvi_MOD13C1.006

# import band 1 = NDVI
r.modis.import files=$USER/data/ndvi_MOD13C1.006/listfileMOD13C1.006.txt \
  spectral="( 1 )" method=bilinear -w

# create empty temporal DB
t.create type=strds temporaltype=absolute output=ndvi_16_5600m \
  title="Global NDVI 16 days MOD13C1" \
  description="MOD13C1 Global NDVI 16 days" semantictype=mean

# register datasets (tempfile name is provided by r.modis.import -w
t.register input=ndvi_16_5600m file=$USER/tmp/grass7-user-5370/tmp_rGPcg
</pre></div>

First, visualize the NDVI time series in a location with <em>g.gui.tplot</em>:

<div class="code"><pre>
g.gui.tplot strds=ndvi_16_5600m coordinates=146.537059538,-29.744835966
</pre></div>

<div align="center" style="margin: 10px">
<a href="global_ndvi.png">
<img src="global_ndvi.png" width="500" alt="Global NDVI from MOD13C1 product" border=0>
<a href="time_series_ndvi.png">
<img src="time_series_ndvi.png" width="400" alt="NDVI time series, 2015-2016" border=0>
</a><br>
<i>Global NDVI from MOD13C1 product (right) and an example of a time series in southeastern Australia (left).</i>
</div>

Now, identify seasons based on a fixed threshold and a minimum duration. The
threshold and duration were visually estimated from the time series plot for
the example.

<div class="code"><pre>
r.seasons input=`g.list rast pat=MOD13* sep=,` prefix=ndvi_season n=3 \
  nout=ndvi_season threshold=3000 min_length=6

# the outputs are: 
g.list type=raster pattern=ndvi_season*
ndvi_season
ndvi_season1_end1
ndvi_season1_end2
ndvi_season1_start1
ndvi_season1_start2
ndvi_season2_end1
ndvi_season2_end2
ndvi_season2_start1
ndvi_season2_start2
ndvi_season3_end1
ndvi_season3_end2
ndvi_season3_start1
ndvi_season3_start2
</pre></div>

And finally, let's visualize ndvi_season and start1 and end1 of season 2:

<div class="code"><pre>
# set comparable color table to plot start and end
r.colors map=ndvi_season2_start1,ndvi_season2_end1 color=viridis
</pre></div>

<div align="center" style="margin: 10px">
<a href="number_seasons_ndvi.png">
<img src="number_seasons_ndvi.png" width="600" alt="Number of seasons in global NDVI" border=0>
</a><br>
<i>Number of seasons in global NDVI, 2015-2016.</i>
</div>

<p>
<div align="center" style="margin: 10px">
<a href=".ndvi_season2_start1png">
<img src="ndvi_season2_start1.png" width="500" alt="Start of season 2" border=0>
<a href="ndvi_season2_end1.png">
<img src="ndvi_season2_end1.png" width="500" alt="End of season 2" border=0>
</a><br>
<i>Start (right) and end (left) of season 2 (unit is map index).</i>
</div>
