<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.hants</em> performs a harmonic analysis of time series in order to 
estimate missing values and identify outliers. For each input map, an 
output map with the suffix <em>suffix</em> (default: _hants) is created.

<p>
The option <b>nf</b>, number of frequencies, should be carefully chosen. 
Different numbers of frequencies should be tested first on a small test 
region before running the module on the full region. As a rule of thumb, 
the number of frequencies should be at least 
<em>estimated periodicity + 3</em>, e.g. for NDVI with an annual cycle 
(one peak per year), the number of frequencies should be at least 4 when 
analysing one year. If two peaks are assumed per year, the number of 
frequencies should be at least 5 when analysing one year.

<p>The number of frequencies should also not be too large. With a large 
number of frequencies, outliers can not longer be identified because the 
fit is &quot;too good&quot;, outliers can be represented by the estimate. 
The number of frequencies should also be smaller than <em>n input maps / 2</em>
if missing values should be reconstructed.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
If the <em>range=</em> option is given, any values which fall outside
that range will be treated as if they were NULL.
The <em>range</em> parameter can be set to <em>low,high</em> thresholds:
values outside of this range are treated as NULL (i.e., they will be
ignored by most aggregates, or will cause the result to be NULL if -n is given).

<p>
The <em>low,high</em> thresholds are floating point, so use <em>-inf</em> or
<em>inf</em> for a single threshold (e.g., <em>range=0,inf</em> to ignore
negative values, or <em>range=-inf,-200.4</em> to ignore values above -200.4).

<p>
The number of raster maps to be processed is given by the limit of the
operating system. For example, both the hard and soft limits are
typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. <tt>ulimit -n
1500</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but not higher than the hard
limit. If it is too low, you can as superuser add an entry in

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          1500
</pre></div>

This would raise the hard limit to 1500 file. Be warned that more
files open need more RAM.

<p>Use the <em>file</em> option to analyze large amount of raster maps 
without hitting open files limit and the size limit of command line 
arguments. The computation is slower than the <em>input</em> option 
method. For every single row in the output map(s) all input maps are 
opened and closed. The amount of RAM will rise linear with the number of 
specified input maps. The input and file options are mutually exclusive.
Input is a text file with a new line separated list of raster map names 
and optional weights. As separator between the map name and the weight 
the charachter | must be used.
