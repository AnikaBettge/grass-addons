<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>r.hants</em> performs a harmonic analysis of time series in order to 
estimate missing values and identify outliers. For each input map, an 
output map with the suffix <em>suffix</em> (default: _hants) is created.

<p>
The option <b>nf</b>, number of frequencies, should be carefully chosen. 
Different numbers of frequencies should be tested first on a small test 
region before running the module on the full region. As a rule of thumb, 
the number of frequencies should be at least 
<em>estimated periodicity + 3</em>, e.g. for NDVI with an annual cycle 
(one peak per year), the number of frequencies should be at least 4 when 
analysing one year. If two peaks are assumed per year, the number of 
frequencies should be at least 5 when analysing one year.

<p>The number of frequencies should also not be too large. With a large 
number of frequencies, outliers can no longer be identified because the 
fit is &quot;too good&quot;, outliers can be represented by the estimate. 
The number of frequencies should also be smaller than <em>n input maps / 2</em>
if missing values should be reconstructed.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

The optional <em>amplitude</em> and <em>phase</em> output maps contain 
the amplitude and phase for each frequency. The amplitude maps can be 
used to identify the dominant frequency with <em>r.series 
method=max_raster</em>. The baseline frequeny (base period) has the 
suffix <em>.0</em>, its first harmonic has the suffix <em>.1</em>, its 
second harmonic has the suffix <em>.2</em>, etc. The value of the 
output of <em>r.series method=max_raster</em> is identical to the 
number of the suffix. With the <em>amplitude</em> output maps for NDVI 
input, this can be used to determine the number of peaks in vegetation 
growth within the base period, where 0 (zero) means that the dominant 
frequency is the base period, i.e. one peak per base period.

<p>
If the <em>range</em> option is given, any values which fall outside
that range will be treated as if they were NULL.
The <em>range</em> parameter can be set to <em>low,high</em> thresholds:
values outside of this range are treated as NULL.

<p>
The <em>low,high</em> thresholds are floating point, so use <em>-inf</em> or
<em>inf</em> for a single threshold (e.g., <em>range=0,inf</em> to ignore
negative values, or <em>range=-inf,-200.4</em> to ignore values above -200.4).

<p>
The maximum number of raster maps that can be processed is given by the 
per-user limit of the operating system. For example, the soft limits 
for users are typically 1024. The soft limit can be changed with e.g. 
<tt>ulimit -n 4096</tt> (UNIX-based operating systems) but not higher 
than the hard limit. If it is too low, you can as superuser add an 
entry in

<div class="code"><pre>
/etc/security/limits.conf
# &lt;domain&gt;      &lt;type&gt;  &lt;item&gt;         &lt;value&gt;
your_username  hard    nofile          4096
</pre></div>

This would raise the hard limit to 4096 files. Also have a look at the 
overall limit of the operating system
<div class="code"><pre>
cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max
</pre></div>
which is on modern Linux systems several 100,000 files.


<p>Use the <em>file</em> option to analyze large amount of raster maps 
without hitting open files limit and the size limit of command line 
arguments. The computation is slower than the <em>input</em> option 
method. For every single row in the output map(s) all input maps are 
opened and closed. The amount of RAM will rise linear with the number of 
specified input maps. The input and file options are mutually exclusive.
Input is a text file with a new line separated list of raster map names.

<p>For the usage of the option <b>fet</b> see Roerink et al. (2000). Its
value is relative to the value range of the variable being considered.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Precipitation data example</h3>
This small example is based on a climatic dataset for North Carolina which
was from publicly available data (monthly temperature averages and monthly
precipitation sums from 2000 to 2012, downloadable as
<a href="http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea592/common/media/02/nc_climate_spm_2000_2012.zip">GRASS GIS 7 location</a>):


<div class="code"><pre>
# set computational region to one of the maps
g.region raster=2004_03_tempmean -p
</pre></div>

Visualize the time series as animation:
<div class="code"><pre>
# note: color table is different from standard "celsius"
g.gui.animation rast=`g.list type=raster pattern="*tempmean" sep=comma`
</pre></div>

<p>
Since HANTS is CPU intensive, we test for now at lower resolution:
<div class="code"><pre>
g.region -p res=5000

# HANTS: Harmonic analysis of the 156 input maps...
# just wildly guessing the parameters for a test run:

# generate and check list of input maps (the order matters!)
g.list type=raster pattern="20??_??_tempmean" output=tempmean.csv

r.hants file=tempmean.csv \
  nf=6 fet=0.1 dod=5 delta=0.1 base_period=12

# assign reasonable color tables for temperature
for map in `g.list type=raster pattern="*tempmean_hants"` ; do
    r.colors $map color=celsius
done

# assign degree Celsius color table
r.colors 2000_06_tempmean_hants color=celsius

# verify with one of the 156 results (still at reduced resolution):
r.mapcalc "2000_06_tempmean_diff = 2000_06_tempmean - 2000_06_tempmean_hants"

r.colors 2000_06_tempmean_diff color=differences
d.mon wx0
d.rast 2000_06_tempmean_hants
d.rast 2000_06_tempmean_diff


r.univar 2000_06_tempmean_diff -g
n=5066
null_cells=5040
cells=10106
min=-0.0899336115228095
max=0.359362050140941
range=0.449295661663751
mean=0.188579838052468
...

# see HANTS time series as animation
g.gui.animation rast=`g.list type=raster pattern="*tempmean_hants" sep=comma`


# Check HANTS behaviour in a given point 
east=740830
north=168832

for map in `g.list rast pat="20??_??_tempmean"` ; do   
  r.what map=$map coordinates=$east,$north >> time_series_orig.csv
done

for map in `g.list rast pat="*tempmean_hants"` ; do 
  r.what map=$map coordinates=$east,$north >> time_series_hants.csv 
done

# merge files:
echo "east|north|temp_orig|temp_hants" > time_series_final.csv

paste -d'|' time_series_orig.csv time_series_hants.csv | \
      cut -d'|' -f1,2,4,8 >> time_series_final.csv

# Resulting CSV file: 'time_series_final.csv'
</pre></div>

<h3>Using t.* modules to check for basic statistics</h3>

The temporal framework (t.* modules) can be used to assess basic statistics:

<div class="code"><pre>
# create spatio temporal data set with hants output maps
t.create type=strds temporaltype=absolute  output=tempmean_hants \
  title="Mean Temperature HANTS" description="Mean Temperature reconstructed with HANTS"

# register maps in the strds
t.register -i type=raster input=tempmean_hants \
  maps=`g.list raster pattern=*tempmean_hants sep=,` start="2000-01-01" \
  increment="1 months"

# getting general info of the strds (including max and min of the whole series)
t.info type=strds input=tempmean_hants

# getting statistics for each map in the series
t.rast.univar -h tempmean_hants > stats_hants.txt
</pre></div>
