<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>d.frame</em> manages display frames on the user's graphics
monitor. Graphics are displayed in rectangular frames on whatever
graphics monitor the user is currently directing GRASS display output
to. These frames are created and managed with this module.

<p>
Note that GRASS frame contents <em>are not</em> retained when one
frame covers another. You cannot shuffle frames from top to bottom and
then back again. They simply define rectangular areas on the screen
where subsequent drawing will occur.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

The coordinates for the <b>at</b> option are stated in the form:
<em>top,bottom,left,right</em> (the values are in percent). The
upper-left corner of the graphics monitor always is at location 0,0
while the monitor's lower-right corner is always at 100,100.

<p>
If the user has created multiple display frames that overlap one another, 
whatever the user displays in the active frame will overwrite 
those portions of the underlying frame where these frames overlap.
