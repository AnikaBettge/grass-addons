<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>g.gui.metadata</em> support advanced tools for metadata management according to <a
        href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=26020">ISO
    19115</a>.


<p>
    Metadata editor includes graphical interface for conversion metadata from r.info and v.info to ISO based metadata,
    editing metadata files and creating metadata templates. In addition, the graphical module allows validating of
    INSPIRE and GRASS Basic profile.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

For dependencies and installation instructions see <a
        href="http://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/ISO/INSPIRE_Metadata_Support">wiki page</a>.

<h3>Naming of metadata files and storage</h3>


Default location for exported metadata files is
<i>metadata</i> directory in the map's mapset.  For raster maps, the prefix
derived from the current nomenclature is <em>raster</em>, for vector
maps <em>vector</em>. File ends with <em>.xml</em> extension.

<p>
    For example default metadata file name for vector map
    &quot;roads&quot; is <em>vector_roads.xml</em>.


<h3>Metadata profile</h3>

The <i>basic</i> profile is substituted from intersection between
items stored in GRASS native metadata format and INSPIRE profile. The
intersect (subset) includes all available GRASS metadata. Metadata
which cannot be assigned to ISO based attributes are stored in
metadata attribute s<em>abstract</em>. The <i>inspire</i> profile
fulfills the criteria of INSPIRE profile. Values which are not able to
get from native GRASS metadata are filled by text
string <tt>'$NULL'</tt>. This rule applies for both profiles.

<h4>Profile for temporal datast</h4>
This function is based on t.info.iso which allows to create ISO based metadata for temporal maps. Product of this function cannot be compiled by INSPIRE profile becouse a additionl attributes from ISO 19115 package have been added.

<h3>Creation of metadata</h3>

Editor offers two editing modes. The first one allows to create metadata from selected GRASS maps from an active location. The second one allows editing of external metadata file.

<h4>Metadata editor for spatial and temporal maps</h4>

The basis of this editor is similar to r|v.info.iso. After selection of map, the editor convert native metadata of map to ISO based. By exported xml file is metadata editor initialized.
There are three options to select:
<b>basic</b>,
<b>inspire</b> or <b>load
    custom</b>. Last one allows to load metadata profile from file. For example in case of using predefined template. The intersection of GRASS Basic profile(all available metadata for selected map) and loaded custom profile will proced with this selection.


<h4> External metadata editor</h4>
This editor mode allows to load own template and xml file for editing. This option does not support any connection with GRASS maps metadata.


<h3>Defining templates</h3>

<p>
    This function allows to create pattern of metadata profile. In other words it support defining fixed values to
    template. With using created template, the editor does not initialize texts inputs of defined values. These
    attributes is able to see only in Tree Browser in editor. Direct link on this function is multiple editing mode (see
    below).
<p>
    If check-box of metadata attribute is checked, the OWSLib object in template will be replaced by value. Unchecked
    attributes will not change this 'part' of the template.
<p>
    The yellow background of text fields indicates metadata attributes, which are not possible get from GRASS map
    information.


<h3>Editing metadata of multiple map selection</h3>

This option can be used by selection of multiple maps in data catalog. To use pre-defined templete for this editing mode is suitable


<h3>Validation of metadata profile </h3>

On the right side of editor there is a validator of metadata. Currently, validator is able to validate  two build-in profiles. For selection of profile “Load custom” is set by default the inspire profile.


<h3>Updating GRASS native metadata </h3>


The g.gui.metadata module allows updating native GRASS metadata with using modules r.support and v.support. The intersection between ISO based metadata and r|v.support is limited by available parameters for these modules.


<h3>Creating reports for GRASS maps in PDF format</h3>
This function allows to automatically generate  metadata reports to PDF document. Missed values are filled by "Unknown" string.


This tools supports ato generating report
