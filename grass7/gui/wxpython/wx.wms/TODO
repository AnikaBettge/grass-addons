Here is a list of known issues with wms layer implementation. These bugs are known and are to be fixed soon. 

1.Right Indented User Names 
ڝڍڑڭڏڧڲڝڍڑڭڏڧڲ
Arabic String or any right indented string doesnt work quite well with the current version. 

2.Resizing not being done properly

3.Coding Standards of wxgui programming not followed exactly till now. Code to be modified soon for that. 

4.UserName Password not checked if they are required by a particular server or not, currently hard coded. 

5.Layers fetched are not being displayed hierarchly, bug known, to be fixed. 

6.In case, on adding or removing a server, if the write to file is unsuccessful, the application removes it from the serverlist, even though is not written in the file.
So when the application restarts, all the changes done are lost, since data was not written to file successfuly.
