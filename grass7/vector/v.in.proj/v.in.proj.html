<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.in.proj</em> imports selected layers from a OGR raster datasouce 
into the current location and mapset. If the projection of the input 
does not match the projection of the location, the input is reprojected 
into the current location. If the projection of the input does match 
the projection of the location, the input is imported directly with <a 
href="v.in.ogr.html">v.in.ogr</a>.

<h4>Topology cleaning</h4>
When importing polygons, non-topological polygons are converted to 
topological areas. If the original polygons contain errors (unexpected 
overlapping areas or small gaps between polygons), the import might 
need to be repeated using the <em>snap</em> option for <a 
href="v.in.ogr.html">v.in.ogr</a>. In this case, automated import and 
reprojection does not work, and the data need to be manually imported 
first with appropriate settings and optionally cleaned afterwards with 
<a href="v.clean.html">v.clean</a>. The cleaned import can then be 
manually reprojected to the target location.
