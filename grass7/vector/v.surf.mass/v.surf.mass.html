<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.surf.mass</em> creates a raster surface from vector areas, 
preserving the value of the area attribute. For example, if the selected 
area attibute is the population count, the sum of all pixel values in a 
given area is equal to the area's population count.


<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>The current region needs to be prepared with 
<a href="g.region.html">g.region</a>, choosing a resolution such that 
the smallest area is covered by at least four pixels. The current region 
should be completely inside the bounding box of the vector.


<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<h3>Population count interpolation using the North Carolina sample data</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
# List of attributes for the vector censusblk_swwake
v.info -c censusblk_swwake

# Univariate statistics on area sizes,
# only for areas with a population count > 0

v.db.univar censusblk_swwake column=AREA perc=1 -e where="TOTAL_POP > 0"

# The smallest area with some population is 413.8 square meters
# and with a resolution of 10 meters covered by appr. four pixels 
# (depending on the shape of the area
# adjust region
g.region vect=censusblk_swwake res=10 -ap

# mass-preserving area interpolation
v.surf.mass input=censusblk_swwake output=census_blk_swwake column=TOTAL_POP iterations=200
</pre></div>
