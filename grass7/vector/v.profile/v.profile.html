<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>This module will print out distance and attributes of points/lines
along a profiling line. Distance is calculated from the first profiling line
coordinate pair or from the beginning of vector line.<br>
Buffer (tolerance) parameter sets how far point can be
located from profiling line and still be included in output data set.<br>
Output map option can be used to visually check which points are
profiled. Buffer (tolerance) setting does not affect lines. Lines are
sampled at their crossing point with profiling line.<br>
By default Z values are printed if input vector is a 3D map. It can be disabled with
-z flag.<br>
Profiling line can be provided as N,E coordinate pairs or can
come from input vector map. As currently profiling line must be single
line, one should use profile_where parameter to select single line from
profile input map if it contains multiple features.</p>

<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p>Currently module can profile only points and lines (including 3D ones).
Areas and other complex features are not supported. If one can provide
reasonable examples how area sampling should work and why it is
important, area (or any other feature type) sampling can be added.</p>

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

Get point values and distance from the city and save into file for
later usage. We will use comma as delimiter and three numbers after decimal
separator for distance. Output file will contain data for all points,
that are within 100m range to profiling line (Spearfish dataset).

<div class="code"><pre>
v.profile input=archsites map_output=profiling_line buffer=100 \
          east_north=591518.55,4925722.38,592110.14,4920989.67 \
	  output=archsites_distance.csv dp=3 separator=comma

# Now let's see the output:
$ cat archsites_distance.csv
Number,Distance,cat,str1
1,446.958,24,"Hanson Ranch"
2,1386.149,11,"No Name"
3,2754.872,2,"No Name"
4,4559.578,13,"No Name"
</pre></div>

<p>
Create river valley crossection and provide river marker:

<div class="code"><pre>
# Take elevation samples
r.profile input=elevation.dem@PERMANENT output=/home/user/elevation.profile \
  profile=600570.27364,4920613.41838,600348.034348,4920840.38617
# Now get distance to place where river marker should be set
v.profile input=streams@PERMANENT output=river_profile.csv \
  east_north=600570.27364,4920613.41838,600348.034348,4920840.38617
</pre></div>

<h2>BUGS</h2>

<p>Strings are enclosed in double quotes ", still quotes within string are
not escaped.</p>
<p>
Output does not contain Vector CAT values. Only way how to get CAT value is from
the attribute table.</p>
<p>If sampled feature (point, line) contains multiple attribute entries
(has multiple CAT values), only the first one is reported. If this is a
limitation in some practical use case, open a feature request in GRASS GIS
issue tracker.</p>
