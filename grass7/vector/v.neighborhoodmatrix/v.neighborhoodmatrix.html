<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.neighborhoodmatrix</em> identifies all adjacency relations between
polygons in a vector map and exports these as a 2xn matrix where n is the 
number of neighborhood relations with each relation only listed in one 
direction (i.e. if a is neighbor of b, the list will contain a,b, but 
not b,a) unless the <em>b</em> flag is specified.
It uses <em>v.to.db</em> to determine neighborhood relations.
If a path to an output file is specified, the matrix will be written to that file, otherwise it will be sent to standard output.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

Currently the module assumes that the layer above the layer containing the
polygons is empty and available for adding categories to boundaries.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

Send the neighborhood matrix of the counties in the boundary_county map of the North Carolina dataset to standard output:

<div class="code"><pre>
v.neighborhoodmatrix in=boundary_county sep=,
</pre></div>

Idem, but sending the output to a file

<div class="code"><pre>
v.neighborhoodmatrix in=boundary_county sep=, output=county_neighbors.csv
</pre></div>
