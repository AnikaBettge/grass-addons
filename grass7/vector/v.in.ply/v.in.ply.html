<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.in.ply</em> imports a vector map in PLY vector format. A PLY 
file always holds a number of vertices which are imported as points. PLY 
vertices can have a number of properties in addition to their 
coordinates. These properties are stored in an attribute table. For 
larger PLY files with many vertices (> 1000) it is highly recommended 
to not use dbf as database driver, but sqlite, PostgreSQL or MySQL, 
because the dbf driver is rather slow and can consume a lot of memory. 
The database driver can be set with <em>db.connect</em>.
