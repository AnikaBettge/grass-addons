<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>v.class.mlR</em> is a wrapper script that uses the R caret package 
for machine learning in R to classify features using training features 
by supervised learning.

<p>The user can provide input either as vector maps (<em>segments_map</em>
and <em>training_map</em>, or as csv files (<em>segments_file</em> and
<em>training file</em>, or a combination of both. Csv files have to be
formatted in line with the default output of 
<a href"v.db.select.html">v.db.select</a>, i.e. with a header. The field
separator can be set with the <em>separator</em> parameter.
Output can consist of either additional columns in the vector input map 
of features, a text file (<em>classification_results</em>) or reclassed 
raster maps (<em>classified_map</em>).

<p>The user has to provide the name of the column in the training data
that contains the class values (<em>train_class_column</em>), the prefix
of the columns that will contain the final class after classification
(<em>output_class_column</em>) as well as the prefix of the columns that
will contain the probability values linked to these classifications 
(<em>output_prob_column</em> - see below).

<p>Different classifiers are proposed <em>classifiers</em>: 
k-nearest neighbor (knn and knn1 for k=1), support vector machine 
with a radial kernel (svmRadial), random forest (rf) and recursive 
partitioning (rpart). Each of these classifiers is tuned automatically 
throught repeated cross-validation. caret will automatically determine 
a reasonable set of values for tuning. See the 
<a href="http://topepo.github.io/caret/modelList.html">caret webpage</a> 
for more information about the tuning parameters for each classifier, and
more generally for the information about how caret works. By default, the
module creates 10 5-fold partitions for cross-validation and tests 10 
possible values of the tuning parameters. These values can be changed 
using, repectively, the <em>partitions</em>, <em>folds</em> and
<em>tunelength</em> parameters.

<p>The user can define a customized tunegrid for each classifier, using
the <em>tunegrids</em> parameter. Any customized tunegrid has to be defined
as a Python dictionary, with the classifiers as keys, and the input to 
expand.grid() as content as defined 
<a href="http://topepo.github.io/caret/model-training-and-tuning.html#alternate-tuning-grids">
	in the caret documentation</a>.

<p>For example, to define customized tuning grids for svmRadial and 
RandomForest, the user can define the paramter as:<br>
<div class="code"><pre>
tunegrids="{'svmRadial': 'sigma=c(0.01,0.05,0.1), C=c(1,16,128)', 'rf': 'mtry=c(3,10,20)'}"
</pre></div>

<p>The module can run the model tuning using parallel processing. In order
for this to work, the R-package <em>doParallel</em> has to be installed. The
<em>processes</em> parameter allows to chose the number of processes to
run.

<p>The user can chose to include the individual classifiers results in
the output (the attributes and/or the raster maps) using the <em>i</em>
flag, but by default the output will be the result of a voting scheme 
merging the results of the different classifiers. Votes can be weighted 
according to a user-defined mode (<em>weighting_mode</em>): simple majority
vote without weighting, i.e. all weights are equal (smv), simple weighted 
majority vote (swv), best-worst weighted vote (bwwv) and quadratic 
best-worst weighted vote (qbwwv). For more details about these voting 
modes see Moreno-Seco et al (2006). By default, the weights are calculated 
based on the accuracy metric, but the user can chose the kappa value as an 
alternative (<em>weighting_metric</em>).

<p>In the output (as attribute columns or text file) each weighting schemes 
result is provided accompanied by a value that can be considered as an
estimation of the probability of the classification after weighted vote, 
based on equation (2) in Moreno et al (2006), page 709. At this stage, this
estimation does not, however, take into account the probabilities determined
individually by each classifier.

<p>Optional output of the module include detailed information about the 
different classifier models and their cross-validation results 
<em>model_details</em> (for details of these results see the train, 
resamples and confusionMatrix.train functions in the caret package)  a 
box-and-whisker plot indicating the resampling variance based on the 
cross-validation for each classifier (<em>bw_plot_file</em>) and a csv 
file containing accuracy measures (overall accuracy and kappa) for each 
classifier (<em>accuracy_file</em>). The user can also chose to write the 
R script constructed and used internally to a text file for study or further 
modification.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
The module can be used in a tool chain together with <a href="i.segment.html">i.segment</a>
and the addon <em>i.segment.stats</em> for object-based classification of 
satellite imagery.

<p><em>WARNING:</em> The option output files are created by R and currently
no checking is done of whether files of the same name already exist. If they 
exist, they are silently overwritten, regardless of whether the GRASS GIS 
<em>--o</em> flag is set or not.

<p>The module makes no effort to check the input data for NA values or 
anything else that might perturb the analyses. It is up to the user to 
proceed to relevant checks before launching the module.

<h2>DEPENDENCIES</h2>

<p>This module uses R. It tries to install necessary R packages automatically
if necessary. These include : 'caret', 'kernlab', 'e1071', 'randomForest', and 'rpart'. 
Other packages can be necessary such as 'ggplot2', 'lattice' (for the plots), 
and 'doParallel' (if parallel processing is desired).

<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Check for existing file created by R as no overwrite check is 
		done in R</li>
	<li>Use class probabilities determined by individual classifiers
		to calculate overall class probabilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<p>
Using existing vector maps as input and writing the output to the attribute table of the segments map, including the individual classifier results:
<div class="code"><pre>
v.class.mlR segments_map=seg training_map=training train_class_column=class weighting_mode=smv,swv,qbwwv -i
</pre></div>

<p>
Using text files with segment characteristics as input and writing output to raster files and a csv file
<div class="code"><pre>
v.class.mlR segments_file=segstats.csv training_file=training.csv train_class_column=class weighting_mode=smv,swv,qbwwv raster_segments_map=seg classified_map=vote classification_results=class_results.csv
</pre></div>
