<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>v.class.mlR</em> uses machine learning functions in R to classify
features in a vector map using training features in a second map for 
supervised learning.

<p>
At the current stage it is just a quick and dirty hack to allow students to 
do such classification in the framework of a course. It is meant as a very
simplistic alternative to v.class.ml which can be a bit overwhelming for
newbies.

<p>
Currently, only support vector machine classification is implemented, using
the e1071 CRAN contrib package (which is automatically installed if necessary).
The user has to chose between different kernel types. The module then goes
through tuning across a range of possible parameters using 10-fold cross-
validation. Optionally, the user can determine fixed values for certain 
parameters so that they will be excluded from tuning. This speeds up the tuning
process.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
The module automatically excludes columns that contain empty values in the map
of all features.

<p>
Running the same model with exactly the same specifications generally leads
to differing classification errors. This is due to the cross-validation for
which training and validation sets are drawn randomly. The user can run the
same model call several times to get an idea of the variances of the error.

<p>
The module can be used in a tool chain together with <a href="i.segment.html">i.segment</a>
and the addon <em>i.segment.stats</em> for object-based classification of 
satellite imagery.

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>
If the module is deemed to deserve a longer life-span, than it should possibly
be recoded to use rpy2 instead of simple text batch files for R (although this
latter solution is quite useful in a computer lab where rpy2 is not installed).

<p>
Other classifiers should be included.
