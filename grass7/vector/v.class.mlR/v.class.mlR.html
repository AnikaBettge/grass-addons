<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>
<em>v.class.mlR</em> is a wrapper script that uses the R caret package 
for machine learning in R to classify features using training features 
by supervised learning.

<p>The user can provide input either as vector maps (<em>segments_map</em>
and <em>training_map</em>, or as csv files (<em>segments_file</em> and
<em>training file</em>, or a combination of both. Csv files have to be
formatted in line with the default output of 
<a href"v.db.select.html">v.db.select</a>, i.e. with a header and the
pipe character as field separator.  Output can consist of either 
additional columns in the vector input map of features, a text file 
(<em>classification_results</em>) or reclassed raster maps 
(<em>classified_map</em>).

<p>The user has to provide the name of the column in the training data
that contains the class values (<em>train_class_column</em>), the prefix
of the columns that will contain the final class after classification
(<em>output_class_column</em>) as well as the prefix of the columns that
will contain the probability values linked to these classifications 
(<em>output_prob_column</em> - see below).

<p>Different classifiers are proposed <em>classifiers</em>: 
k-nearest neighbor (knn and knn1 for k=1), support vector machine 
with a radial kernel (svmRadial), random forest (rf) and recursive 
partitioning (rpart). Each of these classifiers is tuned automatically 
throught repeated cross-validation. caret will automatically determine 
a reasonable set of values for tuning. See the 
<a href="http://topepo.github.io/caret/modelList.html">caret webpage</a> 
for more information about the tuning parameters for each classifier, and
more generally for the information about how caret works.

<p>The user can chose to include the individual classifiers results in
the output using the <em>i</em> flag, but by default the output will be
the result of a voting scheme merging the results of the different 
classifiers. Votes can be weighted according to a user-defined mode 
(<em>weighting_mode</em>): simple majority vote without weighting, i.e. 
all weights are equal (smv), simple weighted majority vote (swv), 
best-worst weighted vote (bwwv) and quadratic best-worst weighted vote 
(qbwwv). For more details about these voting modes see Moreno-Seco et al 
(2006). By default, the weights are calculated based on the accuracy 
metric, but the user can chose the kappa value as an alternative 
(<em>weighting_metric</em>).

<p>In the output (as attribute columns or text file) each weighting schemes 
result is provided accompanied by a value that can be considered as an
estimation of the probability of the classification after weighted vote, 
based on equation (2) in Moreno et al (2006), page 709. At this stage, this
estimation does not, however, take into account the probabilities determined
individually by each classifier.

<p>Optional output of the module include detailed information about the 
different classifier models and their cross-validation results 
<em>model_details</em> (for details of these results see the train, 
resamples and confusionMatrix.train functions in the caret package)  a 
box-and-whisker plot indicating the resampling variance based on the 
cross-validation for each classifier (<em>bw_plot_file</em>) and a csv 
file containing accuracy measures (overall accuracy and kappa) for each 
classifier (<em>accuracy_file</em>). The user can also chose to write the 
R script constructed and used internally to a text file for study or further 
modification.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
The module can be used in a tool chain together with <a href="i.segment.html">i.segment</a>
and the addon <em>i.segment.stats</em> for object-based classification of 
satellite imagery.

<h2>DEPENDENCIES</h2>

<p>This modules uses R. The following R-packages have to be installed to be able to use this
module: 'caret', 'kernlab', 'randomForest', 'rpart', 'ggplot2', 'lattice'.

<h2>TODO</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Add automagic installation of missing R packages.</li>
	<li>Add option to manually define grid of tuning parameters</li>
	<li>Check for existing file created by R as no overwrite check is 
		done in R</li>
	<li>Use class probabilities determined by individual classifiers
		to calculate overall class probabilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<p>
Using existing vector maps as input and writing the output to the attribute table of the segments map, including the individual classifier results:
<div class="code"><pre>
v.class.mlR segments_map=seg training_map=training train_class_column=class weighting_mode=smv,swv,qbwwv -i
</pre></div>

<p>
Using text files with segment characteristics as input and writing output to raster files and a csv file
<div class="code"><pre>
v.class.mlR segments_file=segstats.csv training_file=training.csv train_class_column=class weighting_mode=smv,swv,qbwwv raster_segments_map=seg classified_map=vote classification_results=class_results.csv
</pre></div>
