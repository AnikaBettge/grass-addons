<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.civil.river</em> exports and import geometry data to/from an 1-D hydrodynamic model.

<h3>Export</h3>
<p>
To export to an 1-D hydrodynamic model a cross section and 
cross-displ maps from the output of <em>v.civil.road</em> is 
required. And a raster DEM too.

<p>
The edge definition must have two displaced lines, the first
for representing the main channel bank station and the second
for representing the left and right overbanks.

<p>
The cross-displ map have the distance between the cutoffs of the 
displaced lines above and the cross sections. 

<p>
The lines of cross section map are 2D, and the cutoffs above are 
within those lines, so you can move the nodes to adjust the 
lines to the water flow

<p>
You must give a prefix name for output files.
<p>
There are two format files, RS,X,Y,Z format and RS,Station,Elevation:

<ul>
	<li><em>PrefixName</em>_format_xyz.csv</li>
	<li><em>PrefixName</em>_format_stations.csv</li>
</ul>
<p>
The schematic of the edge and the schematic of the river (lowest point of each cross-section)

<ul>
	<li><em>PrefixName</em>_schematic.txt</li>
	<li><em>PrefixName</em>_schematic_real.txt</li>
</ul>
<p>
Tree files to populate geometry tables
<ul>
	<li><em>PrefixName</em>_banks.txt</li>
	<li><em>PrefixName</em>_length.txt</li>
	<li><em>PrefixName</em>_manning.txt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Import</h3>
<p>
To import from 1-D hydrodynamic model a <em>.sdf</em> file (from export gis data
is required with only one profile and with water surface extents.
<p>
The output is a polygon with the water surface extents in each cross-section.
<p>
The <em>-d</em> flag create ASCII file describing the water surface profile
along the channel axis for use within <em>r.inund.fluv</em> addon-module.
