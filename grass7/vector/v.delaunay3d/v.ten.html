<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>v.ten</em> performs 3D triangulation on input 3D vector point
map. Resultant facets (ie. triangles) of tetrahedral network (TEN) are
written as faces. If <b>-l</b> flag is given that the modules writes
edges of the network as lines instead of faces.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

3D triangulation is performed
by <a href="http://www.cgal.org">CGAL</a> library.

<p>
Centroids are treated as points when reading data from the input
vector map. Note that input vector map must be 3D, the output is
always 3D.

<h2>EXAMPLE</h2>

<div class="code"><pre>
# generate random 3D points
v.random out=rp n=100 zmax=100 -z
# perform 3D triangulation
v.ten input=rp output=rp_ten
...
Number of vertices: 100
Number of edges: 491
Number of triangles: 780
Number of tetrahedrons: 390
</pre></div>
